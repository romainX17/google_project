This searching quality is characterized by a thick texture in many of his paintings, influenced by Alberto Giacometti, Frank Auerbach, and Rembrandt van Rijn. Every painting emerges from struggle and re-evaluation.The artist's work has been shown in galleries and museums across the United States, Europe and Asia, including a solo exhibition, Tohu vaVohu  at the Hebrew College in Boston (2004), and Becoming (2006) at the Yale Slifka Center and NYU Bronfman Center. “Commanding visions,” emerge from the midst of Meyer’s thickly layered paint, according to Hebrew College Professor Steven Copeland in the introduction to the 2004 Tohu vaVohu catalog. “He engages...fateful questions concerning the character of art and of Judaism, their possibilities, challenges and problems.”Meyer’s subjects play a hide-and-seek game with the viewer, often dissolving into the paint. According to Allegra Goodman, in the introduction to the 2013 exhibition catalog Rustle, Sparkle, Flutter, Float, these people “will reveal themselves, and they will disappear. Look at them up close and they scatter, self-effacing.” The figures are elusive and appear introspective. “Some artists try to depict our world. Meyer presents people in their own worlds, and invites us to enter.”Meyer is a recipient of a Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant as well as the Sustainable Arts Foundation Award, and a 2010 Painting Fellowship from the Massachusetts Cultural Council.

It was more than a moment of artistic inspiration; it was a reflection of critical self-awareness and the new social role of art - the fundamental essence of the movement.This highly cultural decade in Cuba contrasted a country in transition, whose revelations created one of the most fertile and consecrated artistic decades in its history. The artists who received the most notoriety of this era, both at home and abroad, began their collaboration with the breakthrough of “Volume 1\"   - a commitment to non government mandated artistic expression. They included Rubén Torres Llorca, José Bedia Valdés, Ricardo Rodriguez Brey, Juan Francisco Elso, Rogelio López Marín (Gory), Gustavo Pérez Monzón, José Manuel Fors, Leandro Soto Ortiz, Israel León, Tomás Sánchez and Carlos Alfonzo.In the second half of the decade, other artistic groups were formed, including 4 x 4, Grupo Hexágono, Arte Calle, Grupo Provisional, the duet René Francisco Rodríguez and Eduardo Ponjuán González   and ABTV.

He is best known as the pioneering practitioner of the art form known as Letras y figuras, in which the letters of a patron's name is composed primarily by contoured arrangements of human figures surrounded by vignettes of scenes in Manila - an art form that may have derived loosely from illuminated manuscripts. Santiago Pilar, an authority on 19th-century paintings, described Lozano's works as \"some of the most quaint and endlessly fascinating relics of Filipino culture in Spanish times\".Lozano was the son of a lighthouse keeper at Manila Bay. He grew up in Sampaloc, Manila outside the walled city of Intramuros. A local commentator, Rafael Diaz Arenas, remarked as early as 1850 that Lozano was \"a watercolourist without rival\". Lozano also painted in the conventional costumbrista tradition as a means of supplying the demand for souvenirs of Manila to foreign visitors. He also painted in oils and the Spanish government commissioned him to depict episodes from the history of the colony to be displayed during a fiesta in the district of Santa Cruz, Manila in 1848.\nJosé Maria A. Cariño, author of José Honorato Lozano: Filipinas 1847, surmises that Lozano may have been trained by Chinese painters or Filipino painters skilled in Chinese painting techniques.\nA folio of Lozano's watercolors surfaced in a 1995 episode of Antiques Roadshow (the UK edition) with appraiser Peter Nahum. The album had been commissioned by Emile Nyssens, and was sold at Christie's in 1995 for 265,000 British pounds; and a Spanish marquesa by another—not unless there were two or three separate albums floating around in Europe. But that folio appraised by Nahum went on to sell for GBP240,000 at a later auction.\nIn September 2016, an extremely rare set of 12 watercolors by Lozano, originally in the possession of a Spanish marquess, was offered at auction in Manila with a starting bid of ₱5 million.", "extracts": {"birth": [], "death": [[["1885", 35]]], "nationality": [[["Filipino", 47]]], "painter_name": [[["José Honorato Lozano", 0]]]}}

Many of the portraits he made are lost, but caused admiration among critics, specially because of Freyesleben's comments about the \"square men and women\" that Ghelfi had painted after his return from Europe, which seems to justify his enrollment in cubism. \"Passeio Público\" (Public Park) is particularly meaningful as an example of his aesthetic options and as a document of one of the most traditional Curitiba recesses, also painted by Andersen.

From age 6, he has observed and studied art to acquire a passion for expressing himself using impressionist/figurative views on canvas.\nThough de Brito sculpts and works in ceramic, he favors painting and incorporates his Portuguese roots along with influences of great French fauvists and California impressionists. In previous years, de Brito traveled to New Zealand to paint with Māori artists.\nJoao de Brito has become well known for his use of vibrant colors that elicit light, life, energy and interpretive landscapes. Having unleashed a fresh creativity – inspired by memories of his homeland, scenes from his many travels abroad – de Brito’s oils stimulate the sense of sight to produce emotion and thought. As a result, de Brito’s works appear in galleries, museums, businesses, government agencies and affluent homes around the world.\nJoao was born in Vila Franca do Campo, São Miguel Island in the Azores, Portugal and as a young boy immigrated with his family to the East Coast of the United States. In 1978, the artist settled on California’s Monterey Peninsula where he shares his talents with the local community as well as international art enthusiasts. Though he admits to often ‘swimming against the current', his painting philosophy is to awaken hope, invoke a sense of well-being and share colors of life, de Brito is content to quietly observe nature and to allow his images to speak to the human heart.\nAlong the way, he has had many solo exhibits, he's also been member of several art's organizations, the Santa Cruz Art League, Art Association and Museum and The Beachcombers Club. Joao de Brito’s works have been found at Kate Nolan Santa Cruz, California, Thanassi Gallery in Provincetown Cape Cod, Massachusetts, Monique Arnon Fine Arts Gallery San Francisco, the Hauk Fine Art Gallery Pacific Grove, CA and the Santa Cruz Art Center Gallery, in Santa Cruz, The Foundry Gallery, Berkeley and The Woodside Gallery, Woodside, California.\nHe was also part of group exhibit in 2008 with friends Nathan Oliveira, Mel Ramos and John Mattos, The book Ashes to Life- A Portuguese American Story in Art was published for the exhibit, with interviews with all four artist.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1958", 20]]], "death": [], "nationality": [[["Portuguese", 31], ["American", 42]]], "painter_name": [[["João de Brito", 0]]]}}

At a very early age he began to express his wants by sketching objects with a piece of charcoal. He received his first instructions in art from Fray Vicente de Santo Domingo, a Hieronymite monk at Estella, and also with Becerra. He visited Naples, Rome, Florence and Milan. Pellegrino Tibaldi met him in Rome in 1550.\nAccording to most accounts he was for a considerable time the pupil and assistant of Titian at Venice. In 1568 Philip II of Spain summoned him to Madrid with the title of king's painter and a salary, and employed him to execute pictures for the Escorial.  During the 1560s and 1570s the huge monastery-palace of El Escorial was still under construction and Philip II was experiencing difficulties in finding good artists for the many large paintings required to decorate it.  Titian was very old, and died in 1576, and Tintoretto, Veronese and Anthonis Mor all refused to come to Spain.  Philip had to rely on the lesser talent of Navarrete, whose gravedad y decoro (\"seriousness and decorum\") the king approved.  For eleven years until his death Navarrete worked largely on El Escorial.The most celebrated of the works he produced there are a \"Nativity\" (in which, as in the well-known work on the same subject by Correggio, the light emanates from the infant Saviour), a \"Baptism of Christ\" (now Prado), and \"Abraham Receiving the Three Angels\" (one of his last works, dated 1576, National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin).\nHe executed many other altar-pieces, all characterized by boldness and freedom in design, and by the rich warm colouring which has acquired for him the surname of \"the Spanish Titian.\" He died at the age of 52-53 in Toledo.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1526", 26]]], "death": [[["1579", 42]]], "nationality": [[["Spanish", 101]]], "painter_name": [[["Juan Fernández Navarrete", 0]]]}}

In his Casta sets, much could be determined about the status of the subjects based on their clothing, hair, and surroundings. His paintings featured the Spanish men as the dominant figures in the family. He also used body language to express attitudes and emotions that supposedly resulted from racial mixing.\nApart from Casta painting, Morlete Ruiz followed the trend of exoticism by painting local flora and fauna, especially fruits to show a Spanish audience the bounty of the New World.

He also followed the trend of painting portraits of high officials, such as Viceroy Linares and the local nobility. These works followed European models, with symbols of rank and titles either displayed unattached in the outer portions or worked into another element of the paintings such as curtains. Rodríguez Juárez painted \"an extraordinary self-portrait, symptomatic of the changing role of the artist in the colony in the eighteenth century.\"A set of early casta paintings (ca. 1715) is attributed to him; they are in a private collection at Breamore House, Hampshire, England.

His pieces are held in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art  and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among others.

Sánchez specifically became known for producing brightly hued mixed media canvases that addressed issues of Puerto Rican life in the U.S. and on the island. Of his work, critic Lucy Lippard once wrote: \"it teaches us new ways of seeing what surrounds us.\"Sanchez combines painting and photography with other media clippings and found objects to confront America's political policies and social practices concerning his parents' homeland of Puerto Rico.

Villafuerte is among the ranks of other prominent Latin American painters such as Eduardo Kingman, Enrique Tábara, Aníbal Villacís, Félix Arauz, Oswaldo Guayasamin, Judith Gutierrez, Hernan Zuniga  and Jose Carreño.\nVillafuerte was born on July 19, 1945, in Guayaquil, Ecuador to Manuel Villafuerte and Rosa Estrada.  Juan was the youngest of four brothers, Manuel, and two sisters, Nila and Vilma. Nila was 13 when Juan was born.  Nila later went on to marry Félix Arauz.\n\nIn 1960, Villafuerte attended the School of Beautiful Arts in Guayaquil and was mentored by Theo Constanté, Hans Michelson and Caesar Andrade Faini.  In 1964, Villafuerte and Hernan Zuniga moved to the factory of Juan Manuel Guano to work and live the Boehemian life of an artist.  Villafuerte left the school in 1966 and began drawing from nature. Although Villafuerte did not follow in their footsteps he was greatly inspired by Gilberto Almeida and Enrique Tabara's Pre-Columbian inspired paintings.  After graduation, Villafuerte participated in numerous Collective Exhibitions at the House of Culture, Nucleus of the Guayas, and the Museum of Colonial Art.\nVillafuerte's first solo exhibit in Guayaquil was held at the North American Ecuadorian Center.  The exhibit catalogue and invitations contained extremely enthusiastic commentaries of Villafuerte's work by such writers as, Bolivar Moyano and Diego Oguendo, among other pens.  In the newspaper, the art critic, Manuel Esteban Mejía, spoke of Villafuerte's work at the exhibit saying, \"It is not complacent, or made to please, but to trouble. It outlines deformities\".  Other articles spoke of the works as being at the core of the humanist philosophy.  In 1967, Villafuerte presented an exhibit called Personal Muestra at the Galleria Arte de Quito that consisted of his first series of Vietnam images.  The Vietnam Series lasted until 1973 when the war ended.  In his Vietnam Series, Villafuerte would finish a drawing and rip it up into pieces and fix them to fine cardboard, then he would continue drawing and add in various newspaper and magazine clippings of the war.  In 1968, Villafuerte exhibited with the group, VAN, at The Museum of Colonial Art in Quito.  VAN was a group of modern Informalist artists that primarily consisted of Enrique Tábara, Aníbal Villacís, Estuardo Maldonado, Luis Molinari and Gilberto Almeida, who were in a constant search for a new modern aesthetic derived from Pre-Columbian art.\nVillafuerte left Ecuador in 1968 to study engraving, drawing, and painting at the School of Beautiful Arts in Barcelona.  During his study in Barcelona, Villafuerte became fascinated with the works of Rembrandt, Durero, and Goya, as well as the intense work of Antonio Saura. The definitive irruption of the Neo-figurativism happened at the beginning of the 1970s, where Jose Carreño and Villafuerte represented Spain and Ecuador.\nThe early Seventies saw the emergence of Villafuerte's, Transmutations Series of drawings, which consisted of exploding heads, monstrous creatures, figures of half women and half birds with multiple mouths and protruding veins.   During this time, Villafuerte held many exhibits with the likes of Zuniga, Carreño and Yaulema all across Spain and Ecuador.  Villafuerte was a very hard worker and was known to spend at least 16 hours a day drawing. He was also known to spend hours drawing satirical cartoons, often depicting the impoverished struggles of Latin Americans.  One of his many important works is \"Curas y Saldados\" (1972), which shows the maturity of his drawing and the nerve of the color.\n\n \nVillafuerte died of cancer on August 15, 1977 while living in Barcelona.  He left a great deal of master works behind thanks to his hard working nature.  Much of his work was left to the family in Ecuador; However, there is still a large body of work that remains in Spain with his widow, Aracelli Molina, as well as various galleries and collections throughout Spain and Ecuador.\nOne incident that was widely publicized in both Spain and Ecuador was the brief loss of the corpse of Villafuerte.  After Villafuerte passed in Spain, his father and Nila flew to Spain to bring the body home.  When they arrived back in Guayaquil there was a large crowd gathered to pay respects, but when the plane was unloaded there was no corpse.  It was later discovered that the corpse had accidentally been sent to Lima, Peru.  Once the body was located it was sent back to Guayaquil where it was held under guard for a short period of time at the House of Ecuadorian Culture.  Villafuerte was finally laid to rest at the General Cemetery in Guayaquil.\nVillafuerte took drawing to all possibilities of the imagination, with the highest level of skill.  In 1979, the first retrospective to honor the work of Villafuerte was held at the Centennial Gallery of Guayaquil and since then his legacy has continued to grow and has secured his place among the great Latin American masters of the 20th Century.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1945", 27]]], "death": [[["1977", 45]]], "nationality": [[["Ecuadorian", 1365]]], "painter_name": [[["Juan Villafuerte", 0]]]}}

Lumerman studied there with European trained teachers including Aquiles Badi known for his Constructivist and metaphysical tendencies and es:Emilio Centurion known for his command of volumes and form, as well as with es:Carlos Ripamonte a painter of an earlier generation known for his work in an Impressionist vein.\nIn 1936, Lumerman won first prize in the VI Feminine Salon of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires.  In a 1993 essay, art historian Cesar Magrini evokes the period and describes Lumerman as \"...a pioneer and an explorer of new paths.  Those were years when one could count on the fingers of one hand those women who were permitted to paint, model or sculpt without its being considered a perversion.\"\nBy the early 1940s, Juana Lumerman was showing her painting in Buenos Aires with a mixed group of her accomplished peers.  In 1941, Los Angeles County Museum of Art invited several Argentine artists to represent their country in a US exhibition; the group included Lino Enea Spilimbergo, Raquel Forner, Ramón Gomez Cornet, Antonio Berni, Emilio Pettoruti and Juana Lumerman.\nIn 1945, Juana Lumerman spent a year exhibiting, traveling and working in Brazil.  Throughout Lumerman's career, dynamic images of carnival, soccer and tango were to serve as counterpoints to more statically structured, more metaphysical, cityscape and still life themes in her painting.\nIn 1948, Juana Lumerman traveled to Washington, DC for another invitational show and then toured the US. In 1950, the artist traveled to northern Argentina where much of Buenos Aires' intelligentsia had decamped in an attempt to avoid the constraints of Juan Perón's visual aesthetic.\nDespite her travels to Brazil and to Argentina's colorful northern provinces, Lumerman's palette tended to be cool and tonally somber. The artist typically painted easel-size works in oil on board or canvas using a loosely figurative style notable for its fluidity of line and skillful paint handling.\nIn a 1952 article the British fine art magazine \"The Studio\" names Juana Lumerman, Raquel Forner and  es:Mane Bernardo as the three key women in Argentina's visual arts scene.\nPossibly by choice (?), Juana Lumerman exhibited rarely in subsequent years, with notable exceptions being a solo show at the respected Van Riel Gallery in 1967 and a prestigious 1968 Salon Estimulo show with Argentine masters and contemporary artists including Carlos Alonso, Juan Carlos Castagnino, Riganelli, Policastro, Carlos Ripamonte Berni and Raúl Soldi.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-21067", "doctext": "Judy Ledgerwood (born 1959) is an American abstract painter and educator, who has been based in Chicago. Her work confronts fundamental, historical and contemporary issues in abstract painting within a largely high-modernist vocabulary that she often complicates and subverts. Ledgerwood stages traditionally feminine-coded elements—cosmetic and décor-related colors, references to ornamental and craft traditions—on a scale associated with so-called \"heroic\" abstraction; critics suggest her work enacts an upending or \"domestication\" of modernist male authority that opens the tradition to allusions to female sexuality, design, glamour and pop culture. Critic John Yau writes, \"In Ledgerwood’s paintings the viewer encounters elements of humor, instances of surprise, celebrations of female sexuality, forms of vulgar tactility, and intense and unpredictable combinations of color. There is nothing formulaic about her approach.\" Ledgerwood has exhibited widely at galleries throughout the United States and in Europe and at institutions including the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Smart Museum of Art, and Renaissance Society. Her work belongs to the public art collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Art Institute of Chicago, and Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, among others; a monograph, Judy Ledgerwood, was published in 2009 by Hatje Cantz.

While in the WPA, he worked alongside such well-known artists as Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Milton Avery and Stuart Davis. From 1953 to 1988 Jules Halfant was Art Director of Vanguard Records where he designed albums featuring Joan Baez, Tom Paxton, Country Joe and the Fish, Buffy Sainte-Marie and many other musicians.While attending high school in Brooklyn, New York with Jacob Kainen, Jules submitted his drawings to the National Academy of Design in New York at age of fourteen. He was accepted as a student and studied there in 1924-1927. During the 1930s and 1940s, Jules Halfant created hundreds of paintings depicting street scenes of New York City. He provided the illustrations for Jazz, A People's Music, a 1948 study by Marxist art critic Sidney Finkelstein. Halfant painted his neighbors, parents, friends, shopkeepers, pushcart vendors. Beginning in the 1950s, the artist started to focus on painting Jewish religious and cultural life. He got inspiration from works of great Jewish authors (Dybbuk by S. Ansky, Tevye by Sholem Aleichem, Three Wishes by I. L. Peretz), Biblical stories as well from visiting synagogues where he depicted different aspects of the services and holidays observances. In 1963, Jules Halfant designed the Bob Dylan New York City Town Hall Concert poster.Collections\n\nBrooklyn Museum, New York City, New York\nSmithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.\nWolfsonian–Florida International University, Miami Beach, Florida, The Mitchell Wolfson Jr. CollectionDiscography (Visual)\n\nJoan Baez - Joan Baez ◄ (5 versions) Vanguard 1960\nDoc Watson - Doc Watson Vanguard 1964\nJohn Hammond - Big City Blues (LP, Album, Mono) Vanguard  1964\nJoan Baez - Farewell, Angelina ◄ (4 versions) Vanguard 1965\nBuffy Sainte-Marie - Little Wheel Spin and Spin ◄ (4 versions) Vanguard 1966\nPerrey - Kingsley* - The In Sound from Way Out! ◄ (3 versions) Vanguard 1966\nThe Serpent Power - The Serpent Power Vanguard 1967\nDoc Watson - Home Again! ◄ (2 versions) Fontana 1967\nThe Siegel-Schwall Band - Say Siegel-Schwall ◄ (2 versions) Vanguard 1967\nMississippi John Hurt - The Immortal Mississippi John Hurt ◄ (3 versions) Vanguard 1967\nCircus Maximus - Circus Maximus Vanguard 1967\nCharley Musselwhite - Stand Back!

Julius studied under Eduardo Zamacois as a teenager, under Jean-Léon Gérôme at the École des Beaux-Arts, and later was a pupil of Raymondo de Madrazo.\nStewart's family wealth enabled him to live a lush expatriate life and paint what he pleased, often large-scaled group portraits.

Drexel, leaving for their honeymoon. Subsequent group portraits depicted his friends — including actresses, celebrities and aristocrats — often with a self-portrait somewhere in the crowd.\nHe exhibited regularly at the Paris Salon from 1878 into the early 20th century, and helped organize the \"Americans in Paris\" section of the 1894 Salon. The Baptism (Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1892), which reportedly depicts a gathering of the Vanderbilt family, was shown at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition, and received acclaim at the 1895 Berlin International Exposition.\nHe painted a series of sailing pictures aboard James Gordon Bennett, Jr.'s yacht Namouna.

His father was a local schoolmaster; his much younger mother died from child labour when he was 9 years old. As a child Jóhannes demonstrated a talent for drawing and painting. When the time came, he eventually persuaded his father to allow him to pursue his artistic interests rather than the academic career pre-planned for him.\nHe studied art in Reykjavík and subsequently in Copenhagen in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Although he earned high remarks from his respected tutors, he initially had trouble making a living from his art after his homecoming, working mainly as an illustrator for advertisement agencies. He had trouble \"finding his own style\", and became depressive, which proved to be a blessing in disguise: Rather than painting the \"classic\" landscapes derivative of contemporary Icelandic artists, he began painting dark images from his youth in northern Iceland, seemingly haunted by the early loss of his mother and the strict (though caring) upbringing by his widowed father.\nAround 1965 the local art community started taking more notice of this little known young artist and his \"dark, depressive\" paintings. Art critics heaped praise on his works; this was quintessentially Icelandic art, but under obvious influence from the works of Edvard Munch or even Goya. Over the next few years he became one of the best known, best selling, and most respected painters in Iceland.\nSuccess also spelled the end of his \"depressive era\". Instead he turned his attention to painting Icelandic landscapes, but now with his unique unmistakable style - characterized with bright shining colours depicting (or amplifying) the beauty of a sometimes dull landscape.\nIn the late 1970s, being an established successful artist, Jóhannes could divide some attention to one of his lifelong interests - The Viking Sagas - and incorporate them into his art. For the rest of his life, he made hundreds of illustrations based on the Sagas, ranging all the way from grand oil paintings to small pencil sketches.\nDespite his failing health, Jóhannes kept on working until his dying day. He was one of the most prolific Icelandic artists of his generation, and his works decorate the walls of many public buildings as well as private homes in Iceland.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1927", 37]]], "death": [[["2003", 55]]], "nationality": [[["Icelandic", 68]]], "painter_name": [[["Jóhannes Geir Jónsson", 0]]]}}

His name is associated with the development of a singular theme – the rija. Rijas, or threshing barns, were historically among the oldest structures on the traditional Latvian homestead.  Throughout his half-century of exile from Latvia, Kalmīte transformed the rija into an artistic symbol for the persistence of Latvian ethnic culture in the face of invasion and occupation by foreign powers.Coming of age during the first period of Latvia’s independence between the two World Wars, Kalmīte studied in the figural master studio of Ģederts Eliass at the Latvian Academy of Art, from which he graduated in 1935.  He joined the artists’ society Mūksalieši, whose stated mission was to develop a Latvian national art, following in the footsteps of artists such as Ādams Alksnis and Teodors Ūders.   Kalmīte left Latvia with his wife Alīda (born Zīverts) and infant daughter Guna, as political refugees in 1944, when Latvia was invaded by the Soviet Union. He spent six years as a displaced person in Germany (where a second daughter, Lelde, was born) and then immigrated to America at age forty-three. While he lived to witness the re-establishment of Latvian independence in 1991, he never returned to his homeland. He died at age 89 and his remains were later taken to his hometown of Valmiera, Latvia for interment in the Kalmīte family plot.\nDuring the course of his career, Kalmīte participated in over 100 exhibitions in the United States, Canada, Latvia, Germany, Sweden and other European countries. The 100th anniversary of his birth was commemorated in 2007 with a solo exhibition at the Latvian National Museum of Art in Rīga,  and in a dual exhibition with the work of his artist daughter, Lelde Alīda Kalmīte, at the Valmiera Museum (Valmieras novadpētniecibas muzejs). The Salvatorkolleg in Bad Wurzach, Germany, where Kalmīte and his family lived before immigrating to the United States in 1950, also presented an exhibition of work the artist produced during his years in Germany.\nKalmīte spent the last 46 years of his life in Minnesota, but was never fully integrated either artistically or socially into American society.  His name is virtually unknown in American artistic circles, but within the global Latvian diaspora community his fame grew during his lifetime. After his death a substantial collection of his work was bequeathed to the Valmiera museum,  and the Latvian National Museum of Art also possesses a collection of his paintings, including several early pre-war works. His paintings may be found in hundreds of private collections throughout the world, and Gallery Antonija in Rīga represents his work today.\nAlthough his work is strongly nationalistic, Kalmīte was intensely interested in the development of Modernism and he described himself as an expressionist. The work of Vincent van Gogh was a major early influence, and he greatly admired many European modernist artists, such as Rouault, Vlaminck and, in particular, Braque. After immigrating to the United States, he was also influenced by American Abstract Expressionism, and stylistically his late works grew increasingly abstract.  Today his work is becoming better known in his homeland, as the history of Latvian diaspora art begins to be absorbed into the overall history of Latvian 20th-century art.\n\n\n== Notes ==", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1907", 23]]], "death": [[["1996", 53]]], "nationality": [[["Latvian", 70]]], "painter_name": [[["Jānis Kalmīte", 0]]]}}

He also received the honor of having some of his works displayed at the 1876 Paris International Exposition.However, despite these honors, the economic turmoil created by the fall of the shogunate in 1868 forced Hōgai to seek to support himself with income via more mundane methods. He worked at casting iron, reclaiming land, and running a shop selling writing instruments. In 1877 Hōgai returned to Edo, now called Tokyo, and worked for the wealthy Shimazu clan; this gave him the opportunity to study works by some of Japan's greatest painting masters, including Sesshū and Sesson.\nIn 1884, Hōgai attracted the attention of Ernest Fenollosa, an art critic and collector from New England, who befriended him and bought several of his paintings.

Over the following years, he was given many highly prestigious commissions. Over the 1620s and 1630s, he created a number of large-scale works for Edo Castle, Nijō Castle, Osaka Castle, Nagoya Castle, and Nikkō Tōshō-gū.\nProlific in a variety of painting styles, Tan'yū's most famous works are probably those he produced for these large-scale commissions. They are screens and panels, prime examples of the Momoyama style, depicting natural subjects such as tigers, birds and plants, in bright colors and with extensive use of gold leaf. The gold, often used to represent clouds, water, or other background elements, would reflect what little light was available indoors, brightening a castle's dark rooms.\nTan'yū was also accomplished, however, in monochrome ink painting based on the prototypical style of the Muromachi period, yamato-e compositions in a style similar to that of the Tosa school, and Chinese style scrolls. His most famous yamato-e work is a narrative handscroll depicting the life of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first Tokugawa shōgun and major figure in Japanese history.

De Nerée's literary writing and art work was very much inspired by decadent and symbolist authors such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine or Gabriele d'Annunzio, and artists as de Feure, Goya, Johan Thorn Prikker, and Jan Toorop. He more and more focused on his art. Only posthumously, in 1916, two poems were publiced in a French periodical.\nIn 1901, the Nerée worked in Madrid for Foreign Affairs He caught TBC, a disease that would determine his further life. In Madrid De Nerée was visited by his friend Henri van Booven, the future biographer of Louis Couperus, who later gave a thinly veiled report of this visit in his novel Een liefde in Spanje ('A Love in Spain', 1928). De Nerée also inspired Van Booven to write his volume of (prose) poems Witte Nachten ('White Nights', 1901) and the novel Tropenwee ('Tropical Agony', 1904), the latter being a Conrad-like report of his traumatic visit to the Belgian Congo.\nIn his turn Van Booven gave De Nerée The Early Work (1899) by Aubrey Beardsley. This was obviously great influence  on De Nerée's style of drawing.  Later, around 1904-1905, he developed his own unique style.

Only after his death was his work exhibited. He did sell some work during his life though. \nDue to his poor health, drawing and painting became ever more difficult after 1906-1907. The little known works from his later period are characterized by their colors and sometimes almost modernist compositions. He died on 19 October 1909 at 29 years of age, in the southern German town of Todtmoos. He was buried in Clarens, near Montreux.\nThe nature of his work, the Beardsley-replication and the somewhat'decadent' character, set de Nerée naturally in a somewhat isolated position in art history.

He was the only surviving son of Joseph Herman and Katherine (née Hörth) Buesgen, both second generation German immigrants who worked in Allentown's silk and textile mills. As a young man, Buesgen studied to become a musician, and trained in piano, organ and voice.  His family was involved with Allentown's Sacred Heart of Jesus Roman Catholic Church (his grandfather, Henry Buesgen, was a founding member), and he soon became a student of that church's organist and choirmaster, John Birmelin.  When Birmelin retired in 1950, Buesgen was given Birmelin's post - a position he would hold for the remainder of his life.  Buesgen also actively worked as a piano, organ and voice teacher in Allentown, and served as organist and choirmaster for a number of local churches.\nBuesgen was a dedicated student of painting, and studied with both Walter Emerson Baum (1884–1956) and John E. Berninger (1897–1981). Like most impressionist painters, Buesgen painted landscapes en plein air (directly from nature) or from colored slides of photographs he took with his camera.\nThe greatest influence to Buesgen's work was John E. Berninger, his friend and teacher.  For 40 years, Berninger and Buesgen spent nearly every Saturday visiting and talking, and every Sunday afternoon painting together. This relationship continued until Berninger's death in 1981. Buesgen died later that same year.\nFrom June 2 – July 6, 2005, the Baum School of Art hosted a solo exhibition of Buesgen's paintings.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-21624", "doctext": "Karl Kvaran (November 17, 1924  – August 9, 1989) was an Icelandic painter and draughtsman. He was born in Borðeyri in western Iceland and died in Reykjavík.  He is considered one of the principal exponents of the geometric abstractionist school of painting in\nIceland in the early sixties.Kvaran studied at the Iceland Academy of the Arts in Reykjavík (1943–45) and the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, Copenhagen. He also studied under Peter Rostrup Bøyesen.Kvaran was influenced by the abstract art of Svavar Guðnason and Þorvaldur Skúlason, an innovative development of the 1940s. Iceland experienced a period of prosperity in the post-war era and for the first time painters and writers began to form groups and movements. Kvaran and Kristján Davíðsson were important figures in the development of the geometric abstractionist school.In the early part of his career (1942–52) he worked in a French-influenced post-Cubist style. The sculpted, \"hammered\" surface texture of his strongly composed paintings was created using regular, abrupt brush strokes.At the beginning of the 1950s Kvaran abandoned figurative art for geometrical abstraction, using pure, uniform colour to create two-dimensional geometric forms. Kvaran was one of a number of Icelandic artists who contributed to a flourishing geometric abstraction movement during the 1950s.\nBetween 1958 and 1970 the structure of his large gouache paintings and pen-and-ink drawings became more relaxed, with straight lines replaced by a more rhythmic interplay of curved and circular shapes.After 1970 Kvaran began painting much larger works in oil. Static formal shapes were replaced by more fluid constructions in intense shades of red, yellow and blue, accompanied by areas of black and whites. This style is said to have reached the climax of its development around 1979.  His work was characterised by a thriftiness of style alongside increasingly complex dimensional interplay.Kvaran is considered one of the main links between French-derived abstract painting and Minimalism. His daring use of intense colour matched with graphic skills marks him as a bridge between abstraction and Pop Art.Along with Benedikt Gunnarsson, Bragi Ásgeirsson, Eiríkur Smith, Gerður Helgadóttir, Gudmunda Andrésdóttir, Gudmundur Benediktsson, Hafsteinn Austmann, Hjörleifur Sigurdsson, Hördur Ágústsson, Jóhannes Jóhannesson, Jón Benediktsson, Kjartan Gudjónsson, Nína Tryggvadóttir, Svavar Gudnason, Sverrir Haraldsson, Valtyr Pétursson and Thorvaldur Skúlason.

His artwork was shown in museums and at major galleries of Europe at his artistic height (in the 1930s). He was awarded various medals for his works, including a gold medal from the Russian tsar for his \"Battle of Borodin\".\nMatzek fought in the Austrian-Hungarian cavalry in World War I, and was imprisoned in Siberia after the October Revolution. He was able to escape, and in the following years he managed to walk back to Europe, although details of this trek are largely unknown. On a winter day after World War II, he was found sick and half-frozen by villagers of Balatun in Bosnia. He remained in the town, supported by the townspeople in exchange for painting frescos in their churches. Matzek was placed in the most honorable home in the community, of a young widow with three children, the mother of the sculptor Slobodan Pejić. For almost ten years, Matzek educated the boy (he was the only father the boy ever knew; they became inseparable and painted frescos together, the boy painting the lower parts and Matzek painting the upper areas), and eventually married the mother.In Harkanovci there is the parish church of Our Lady,  built in 1799, restored and expanded in 1938. The entire interior was painted with frescoes and stained glass was created for the windows. The frescoes were painted by Karl Matzek in the period from 1955 to 1957. His frescos decorate also churches/monasteries in Janja, in Dragaljevac, in Bijeljina and elsewhere. Earlier Matzek had been sentenced to death by communist authorities, but in Bosnia he was saved by the influence of the parish priest don Mirko Gazivode. In return he painted two murals in the church. Parishioners liked them and then ordered all other frescoes in the church.\nMatzek migrated to Perth, Western Australia, in 1958. There he painted the Stations of the Cross, a series of 14 pictures, in the \"Como Catholic Church\" and in 1961 a series of murals for the Church of Sts. Peter and Paul at the Redemptorist Monastery, North Perth. \nMatzek later moved to Canberra, where a sizeable Serbian immigrant population had accumulated beginning in 1949. The Serbs built St George Serbian Orthodox Church in 1966, after the Government granted them a block of land at the National Circuit, Forrest, close to Parliament House. In the following year, Matzek, then 77, was commissioned to decorate the interior of the church, and for the next 16 years, until his death in 1983, he devoted himself to painting the side walls, ceiling and altar screen, depicting episodes in Serbian history as well as Biblical scenes. Even though the Church itself is small in size, Matzek’s two 20-metre-long panoramas and murals have attracted visitors daily from all parts of Australia and overseas. \nTimes had been rough for many years after his arrival to Australia, but Matzek had hoped that his family could join him there eventually. Since he had moved to Australia and until his death, due to difficulties and expenses involved in global communication in those times, Matzek remained only in written contact with the family in Bosnia, hoping for a long time that they could join him. He sent art books and art journals to Pejić, and supported his family financially as much as possible.Later in his life, during his continued work with the Church, Matzek converted to the Orthodox faith as \"George\". Following a brief illness, Matzek died on 16 April 1983, and was buried at the St. Sava Monastery Cemetery in Canberra.", "extracts": {"birth": [], "death": [[["1983", 44]]], "nationality": [[["Austrian", 57]]], "painter_name": [[["Karl Matzek", 1552]]]}}

As art director at Universal Pictures for the bulk of the 1930s, Grosz oversaw the company's advertising campaigns and contributed hundreds of his own illustrations. He is especially recognized for his dramatic, colorful posters for classic horror films. Grosz's best-known posters advertised early Universal Classic Monsters films such as Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931), The Mummy (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Beyond the horror genre, his other notable designs include posters for the epic war film All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) and the screwball comedy My Man Godfrey (1936).\nOriginal lithograph copies of his poster art are scarce and highly valued by collectors. Two posters illustrated by Grosz—ads for Frankenstein and The Mummy, respectively—have set the auction record for the world's most expensive film poster. The latter held the record for nearly 20 years and, at the time of its sale in 1997, it may have been the most expensive art print of any kind, including other forms of commercial art as well as fine art. The reference website LearnAboutMoviePosters (LAMP) noted that, as of August 2016, Grosz appeared more than any other artist on its comprehensive list of vintage film posters sold for at least $20,000.Despite the growth in his artwork's valuation and prominence, very little biographical information about Grosz is known. He was born in Hungary around 1896, immigrated to the United States in 1901, became a naturalized American citizen, lived in New York, and worked in film advertising between approximately 1920 and 1938.

In 2014, Downie was commissioned as an artist-in-residence at the Forth Road Bridge, to create an exhibition and work to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the bridge's construction. She described her role as conducting \"an in-depth interview\" with the structure, in order to gather the information and ideas to inform her work. She also climbed to the top of the structure, and spent two months working in an improvised studio directly under the bridge.Described by journalist Jan Patience as \"sure, deft and fearless\", examples of Downie's art are held in the Glasgow Museums, including figurative works, such as 12 Minute Baby (1993) and urban landscapes such as Blue Night, Yellow Roof (1991).In late September 2014 Downie set off for 3 months of travel in Australia and Japan, carrying out research of river systems, estuaries and bridges on the edge of the western Pacific Ocean. This culminated in a 2nd major solo exhibition with the Scottish Gallery Estuary  in Edinburgh in April 2015. That same month also featured a two-person show ‘Drawing on the Landscape’ at Cobalt Contemporary in Pittenweem. Both shows were reviewed by the Times, The Scotsman and Studio International.\n\n\n== References ==", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1958", 18]]], "death": [], "nationality": [], "painter_name": [[["Kate Downie", 0]]]}}
{"docid": "Wikipedia-21701", "doctext": "Kate Freeman Clark (September 3, 1875 – March 3, 1957) was an American painter born in Holly Springs, Mississippi.\nClark was the daughter of Edward Clark, an attorney in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Cary Freeman Clark, whose great-uncle was Edward Cary Walthall. An only child, she was named for her grandmother, and was called \"Little Kate\" to distinguish her from \"Mama Kate\". Soon after her birth her father purchased a plantation which would later become the centerpiece of the town of Cary, named for his wife. Kate and her mother summered in Holly Springs, where the air was considered cleaner than along the Mississippi Delta, and Edward would write his daughter long letters during these absences.Edward Clark died of pneumonia in 1885, soon after being named assistant to L. Q. C. Lamar, Edward Walthall's former law partner who had been named Grover Cleveland's Secretary of the Interior. At his death Kate and her mother moved to Freeman Place in Holly Springs, which had been the Walthall family residence. The family soon moved to New York City, where Kate attended finishing school at the Gardiner School, from which she graduated in 1891. In 1893 the two went to the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which fired in the young woman a passion for art. Upon returning to New York City, she enrolled in the Art Students League in 1894; there she studied drawing with John Henry Twachtman and watercolor with Irving Ramsay Wiles.It was Wiles who introduced her to William Merritt Chase, who would teach her still-life and plein air painting and would serve as her mentor until his death in 1916. The tidy watercolor medium was often used by women at the era, but upon witnessing Chase paint in oil while outfitted in a white flannel suit, Clark took up his favored medium. Chase respected her work highly, choosing two of her paintings for his personal collection. Clark and her mother summered on eastern Long Island during the late 1890s; Cary also traveled to Washington, D.C. for the social season there in 1896, in which year Kate attended classes at the Corcoran School of Art. She also attended the New York School of Art and the Shinnecock School of Art; she would remain in New York for the winters while traveling to resort areas in Vermont and Connecticut in summers.Clark took to signing her works with \"Freeman Clark\" or \"K. Freeman Clark\" so that her gender was not immediately apparent. She began exhibiting, showing her work at the National Academy of Design in 1905. Further exhibitions followed, at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and at the National Academy and Society of American Artists in New York. She was the subject of a number of one-woman shows, and spoke to the Macbeth Gallery to discuss selling her paintings through them.Clark had returned to Mississippi sporadically over her career to attend to family obligations, but she spent the bulk of her artistic life in New York; only two paintings on Mississippi subjects are known to exist. However, in 1924, after over 20 years in New York Clark returned to Mississippi and her southern roots, leaving the art world behind forever. Her reasons are unknown, but it has been speculated that the death of her mentor Chase in 1916, followed by that of her grandmother in 1919 and her mother in 1922, was a blow from which she never recovered. Chase's death especially seems to have hit her hard; she was pained that she could not attend the auction of his studio effects in time to purchase some memento of him, most especially an old, black kettle which he had painted numerous times and which was sold for seven dollars to somebody else. Clark also appears to have foreseen the rise in modernism which followed the Armory Show. Her family is known to have been against her career, and warned her against operating, as her uncle Russell Freeman wrote her, \"in spheres of life which belong to men\". Her temperament has been described as \"depressive\", which may have contributed to her withdrawal from the art world.Clark never married; her one serious suitor, Hamilton Foley, was a West Point cadet who went to the Philippines during the Spanish–American War and was court-martialed for embezzlement in 1905. She rarely spoke of her artwork upon her return to Holly Springs. At her death, however, she bequeathed several hundred paintings and drawings, which had been held in storage in the Lincoln Warehouse in New York, to the town, along with her house and with money to build a museum to house the art. These works provided the backbone for the Kate Freeman Clark Museum in Holly Springs. The museum, which apart from a handful of pieces by Chase contains only her work, is located next to her former home, and with more than 1,000 of her paintings is believed to be the largest collection of paintings by a single artist anywhere in the world. She had envisioned library space and a room for the display of fashions in the museum as well, but these could not be included in the final design due to a lack of funds.Clark is buried at Hillcrest Cemetery in Holly Springs.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1875", 33]]], "death": [[["1957", 49]]], "nationality": [[["American", 62]]], "painter_name": [[["Kate Freeman Clark", 0]]]}}

She became an artist like her father, and exhibited one painting in 1885 at the Suffolk Street Gallery of the Society of British Artists. Her younger step-brother Horace Walter Gilbert was an artist as well, but he ultimately chose a different career and became a civil servant instead.Kate married in 1880 a widowed schoolmaster named Humphrey Hughes (1833-1885), who had three children from a previous marriage, but Kate never had children of her own. Her husband died five years into their marriage, after which she lived first with her father, and then after her father's death with her uncle the artist George Augustus Williams. Many of her works date from the late 1880s and the 1890s when she lived with these mentors, no doubt receiving encouragement from them both. She would have also shared the latter household with her cousin Caroline Fanny Williams, the daughter of her uncle, and an accomplished painter as well. When Kate's uncle died, she and Caroline parted company, and she ran a boarding house for a time, before retiring to Sutton, Surrey, where she died on 15 April 1916 at an address on Collingwood Road.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1843", 14]]], "death": [[["1916", 19]]], "nationality": [[["British", 458]]], "painter_name": [[["Kate Gilbert", 0]]]}}
