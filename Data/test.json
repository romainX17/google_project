Following the war in 1947, Afewerk decided that he wanted to help rebuild Ethiopia and elected to travel to England to study mining engineering. Before departing, Afewerk, together with other students leaving to study overseas, was addressed by Emperor Haile Selassie. Afewerk recalls being told \"you must work hard, and when you come back do not tell us what tall buildings you saw in Europe, or what wide streets they have, but make sure you return equipped with the skills and the mindset to rebuild Ethiopia\".\nAfewerk had already shown talent as an artist as a child, decorating several walls in his home town. Whilst at boarding school in England, this talent was recognised and encouraged by his teachers. As a result, Afewerk was persuaded to switch from engineering and enroll in Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. He then went on to the Slade School of Art where he studied painting, sculpture and architecture.\nReturning to Ethiopia as a university graduate, Afewerk could have accepted an assigned ministerial post, but instead decided to spend time travelling around the provinces of Ethiopia to get more experience of his native country and culture, which he reflected in his paintings. In 1954, he held his first one-man show in Addis Ababa, at Municipality Hall, that gave him the funds to travel around Europe for two years where he learnt how to design and construct stained glass windows. He also made a special study on Ethiopian illustrated manuscripts in the British Library, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris and the Vatican Library.\nBack in Ethiopia, Afewerk opened a studio in the National Library of Ethiopia. His growing recognition lead to government commissions for murals and mosaics in St George's Cathedral, Addis Ababa, and several of his designs were used on the national stamps. He was also commissioned to produce sculptures of famous Ethiopians, although only the monumental statue of Ras Makonnen in Harrar was completed. Most notably, in 1958 he designed Total Liberation of Africa, a stained  glass piece in the Africa Hall of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa. The three windows cover an area of 150 square meters, and represent the sorrow of Africa's past, the struggle of the present, and hope for Africa's future.\nIn 1961, Afewerk held a major retrospective in Addis Ababa, which led to his painting Maskal Flower being shown at international exhibitions in Russia, the United States and Senegal. Increasing funds allowed Afewerk to travel around the continent of Africa. With much of Africa still emerging from colonialism, Afewerk became fired with black emancipation and the struggles for independence. This is reflected in his paintings of this time, with titles like Backbones of African Civilization and African Unity.\nIn 1964, he became the first laureate of the Haile Selassie I Prize for Fine Arts. As his reputation spread abroad, Afewerk was invited to put on an exhibition in Moscow following which he toured the Soviet Union giving lectures. The American government responded with an invitation for one man exhibitions in Washington D.C. and New York and a similar lecture tour of American universities. Additional international exhibitions followed in Senegal, Turkey, Zaire, the United Arab Republic, Bulgaria, Munich, Kenya and Algeria.\nThrough much of the 1970s, Afewerk was engaged in producing murals and mosaics for many public and religious buildings around Ethiopia, including the mural Last Judgement in the Adigrat Cathedral in Adigrat, Tigray. In 1977, his painting Unity Triptych won the gold medal in the Algiers International Festival.\nThe early 1980s saw a second major exhibition in Moscow and an exhibition in Bonn. In 1981, his painting Self-portrait was the first work by an African artist to enter the permanent collection of the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy.\nIn 1997, he exhibited at the Biennale of Aquitaine, France, winning first prize in the international competition. He was also nominated as the Laureate of the Biennale which gave him membership of the French International Academy of Arts.\nAfewerk Tekle had membership of the Russian Academy of Arts, so he became the first African member in 1983.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Afewerk Tekle", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1932", 61]]], "3_death": [[["2012", 77]]], "4_nationality": [[["Ethiopian", 90]]]}}

Anna Padoa Rizzo later, in 1991, identified the artist as the brothers Agnolo and Donnino (1460-after 1515) di Domenico del Mazziere, who together operated a workshop in Florence from the early 1480s until the first two decades of the sixteenth century. The basis for this identification is the altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with Two Angels and Saints Lucy and Peter Martyr at the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice, which Padoa Rizzo discovered is in fact a documented work by Agnolo and Donnino, commissioned in 1490 for the hospital of Santa Lucia in Florence.Since the two brothers shared a workshop they often collaborated, making it difficult to distinguish their individual styles. Tax documents suggest that Donnino, the elder brother, was the head of the workshop, while the writings of Giorgio Vasari and Filippo Baldinucci indicate that Agnolo was the most talented and better known of the two. Agnolo, along with several other artists including Francesco Granacci, was called to Rome in 1507 to assist Michelangelo with the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Michelangelo ultimately sent these artists back to Florence to finish the chapel himself.\nAgnolo and Donnino painted altarpieces and fresco decorations for a number of churches in Florence and its surroundings. They also painted portraits, mythological panels and religious works for domestic interiors. Their paintings are frequently compared to those of Lorenzo di Credi. Works like the Portrait of a Girl at the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin or Madonna and Child with Two Angels at the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, reflect the influence of contemporary Netherlandish painting. Agnolo was reportedly a pupil of Cosimo Rosselli.

The hunting lodge was designed by Hendrik Petrus Berlage. In 1930, he was commissioned by Jo de Leeuw, owner of the prestigious Dutch department store Metz & Co. to design interiors, window packaging, branding and advertising.

Architype van der Leck, a digital revival of that face by David Quary and Freda Sack of The Foundry, was released in 1994.\nBart van der Leck claimed to be the father of the avant-garde movement.

As a painter of romantic nature, an active participant in the political life and a great connoisseur of music, he announced the beginning of modern art in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Serbia with his rather small but valuable opus of artworks.Although the painter Branko Radulović rounded a cycle which stands at the top of the contemporary Serbian painting for only thirty years of life and ten years of creative work, it hasn't been written much about the artist and today his works are scattered and poorly researched, mostly due to the negligence of profession.\nHe was born on May 26, 1885, in Mostar, where he completed his primary and several years of secondary education which he continued in Belgrade. There he definitely decided to go in for painting and the first step in this regard was made on 9 September in 1903 by entering the Serbian Drawing and Painting School run by Beta Vukanović and Rista Vukanović.Branko immediately accepted academic painting style of Vukanović and in the same year created “A Portrait of Andja Golubović”, and in the style of Beta Vukanović, he worked on silk small lyrical still lives.\nDiploma of the Vukanović’s school from February 1905 was a recommendation to continue his studies at an academy of fine arts in of the European art capitals. As he was late with enrolment in the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, Branko attended the private Painting School of Karel Reisner (1868-1913) which claimed to be a sort of preparatory course for admission to the Academy of Fine Arts.\nIn the autumn of the following year, he was at the Academy, in the class of Vlaho Bukovac,\nwhere he met two other artists, Pero Popović (1881-1941) and Todor Švrakić, with whom in September 1907 he went on to exhibit in Sarajevo in the first exhibition of local academy-trained artists. Branko Radulović painted in a pointillist style, like that of his professor Bukovac,not only during studies in his class but even in 1907 when he moved in the same academy to the special class of professor František Ženíšek. A painting called “A Girl with a Book” from 1908 testifies about it. Soon Branko Radulović freed his painting from pointillist “colored” dots and shorter and longer brushstrokes and took en plein air characteristics, as a girl “In a Walk” was painted in 1911. Departure, moving to Paris at the beginning of 1912 with the invitation of our painter Lazar Drljaca with whom he shared the apartment and studio, marked the most important turning point in the handwriting of the painter Radulović.\nIt is quite certain that Branko Radulović would further transform his expression in Paris in accordance with the current European art if he didn’t set himself one important task – a patriotic one. The echo of the Sarajevo assassination in 1914 traveled all the way to Paris, from where Radulović, for the second time would make his way to the front – firstly he participated in the Balkan wars and then in World War I, where he was killed in 1916.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Branko Radulović", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1881", 18]]], "3_death": [[["1916", 23]]], "4_nationality": [[["Serbian", 35]]]}}

Born in Cork, Smyth studied art at the Crawford College of Art and Design in Cork, where he specialised in painting and graduated with an honours degree in art and design in 1995. Subsidiary subjects included print, video and photography.In January 2000, Smyth exhibited at Lavit gallery with Tom Climent and Martin Finnin. Jo Allen in Circa described Smyth's work as \"tastefully hued paintings of photographs of a pretty woman resting were slick and pleasing to the eye. But they seemed to have little to say beyond their cool, ironic stance.\"Mark Ewart in The Irish Times said the work of each of the three exhibiting artists was \"quite distinctive\", Smyth's colours being toned down to the point where they approached monochrome, and that his work, like Climent's, was nostalgic: \"The paintings of the reclining female figures are particularly atmospheric, the features seeming to melt into an understated, yet fluidly painted background.\"His first solo show took place in November 2001 at the Blue Leaf Gallery, Fairview, of around 25 oil paintings, mostly portraits, using film scenes, his girlfriend, and portraits by artists such as Titian, Klimt and Rembrandt as source material. A concern with tone, light and character created a postmodern style, which he saw as \"timeless\". In 2008 at the Lavit Gallery, Smyth curated Brian Smyth Selects, and chose five artists who, like him, work in representational painting. The artists were Patrick Cashin, Mary Clancy, Philip Lindey, Stephen Murphy, and Jennifer O’Connor.At the start of 2012, Smyth moved to Florence, to study at the Angel Academy of Art.  There, he developed his drawing and painting skills, working under the tutelage of John Michael Angel and Jered Wosnicki.  Working directly from the life model, in a naturalistic style, Smyth's drawings and paintings developed a new level of realism.Smyth began to paint still life paintings, pushing out the boundaries of his use of colour.\nFrom 2013, Smyth became a student instructor, tutoring other students in Bargue drawings and sight size method cast drawings in charcoal.\nIn September 2014, Smyth became an instructor at the Angel Academy, teaching the  life drawing course to new students at the Angel Academy.\nSmyth's work has been exhibited in Ireland (Lavit Gallery and Buckley Fine Art, Cork, and the Oisin gallery, Dublin), the UK (Red Rag Gallery in Stow on the Wold), and abroad (New York, Chicago and Switzerland).", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Brian Smyth", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1967", 18]]], "3_death": [], "4_nationality": [[["Irish", 30]]]}}

His importance resides in his contributions to both Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. Pissarro studied from great forerunners, including Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. He later studied and worked alongside Georges Seurat and Paul Signac when he took on the Neo-Impressionist style at the age of 54.\nIn 1873 he helped establish a collective society of fifteen aspiring artists, becoming the \"pivotal\" figure in holding the group together and encouraging the other members. Art historian John Rewald called Pissarro the \"dean of the Impressionist painters\", not only because he was the oldest of the group, but also \"by virtue of his wisdom and his balanced, kind, and warmhearted personality\". Paul Cézanne said \"he was a father for me. A man to consult and a little like the good Lord\", and he was also one of Paul Gauguin's masters. Pierre-Auguste Renoir referred to his work as \"revolutionary\", through his artistic portrayals of the \"common man\", as Pissarro insisted on painting individuals in natural settings without \"artifice or grandeur\".\nPissarro is the only artist to have shown his work at all eight Paris Impressionist exhibitions, from 1874 to 1886.

This principle informed Koppelman's art, teaching, and his work as an Aesthetic Realism consultant. About the importance of this principle to art and life, Koppelman stated, \"When Eli Siegel showed that what makes a work of art beautiful – the oneness of opposites – is the same as what every individual wants, it was one of the mightiest and kindest achievements of man's mind\".Koppelman's art is noted for its originality, masterful technique, humor, and power.

He was destined for the medical profession, and well educated in Latin and Greek; but, having a natural propensity for the fine arts, he would not apply to his intended vocation, and was allowed to learn the rudiments of design under Perrier and Vouet. At the age of twenty-one he went off to Rome, with no resources; he drew ruins and architectural subjects.After two years thus spent he re-encountered his old fellow-student Pierre Mignard, and by his aid obtained some amelioration of his professional prospects. He studied Raphael and the antique, went in 1633 to Venice, and in 1656 returned to France. During two years he was now employed in painting altar-pieces in the château du Raincy, landscapes, etc. His death was caused by an attack of apoplexy followed by palsy; he died at Villiers-le-Bel, near Paris. He never married.His pictorial works are few; they are correct in drawing, with something of the Caracci in design, and of Titian in colouring, but wanting fire and expression, and insufficient to keep his name in any eminent repute.He is remembered now almost entirely as a writer rather than painter. His Latin poem, De arte graphica, was written during his Italian sojourn, and embodied his observations on the art of painting; it may be termed a critical treatise on the practice of the art, with general advice to students. The precepts are sound according to the standard of his time; the poetical merits slender enough. The Latin style is formed chiefly on Lucretius and Horace.This poem was first published by Mignard, and has been translated into several languages. In 1668 it was turned into French by Roger de Piles; Dryden translated the work into English prose; and a rendering into verse by Mason followed, to which Sir Joshua Reynolds added some annotations.\n\n\n== References ==", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Charles Alphonse du Fresnoy", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1611", 29]]], "3_death": [[["1668", 47]]], "4_nationality": [[["French", 54]]]}}

{"docid": "Wikipedia-07427", "doctext": "Daniel Rabel (1578 - 3 January 1637) was a Renaissance French painter, engraver, miniaturist, botanist and natural history illustrator. He was the son of Jean Rabel (1545–1603) who was official artist at the court of Henri III. Rabel was first employed as a portrait painter by Marie de Medicis, the second wife of Henry IV of France. He served as Engineer in Ordinary for the King for the provinces of Brie and Champagne.\nIn 1612 he became official artist to Duke of Nevers. In 1618 he moved to Saint-Germain-des-Prés, where he painted \"Suite de fleurs\" and \"Ballet de la douairière de Bilbao\". He also painted landscapes in oil, as well as hunting scenes. About 1631 he was appointed official artist to Gaston, Duke of Orléans, Henri IV‘s third son. He went to Paris, commissioned by Louis XIII to paint a portrait of his betrothed, Anne of Austria.The \"Theatrum Florae\" was originally published in Paris in 1622, with later editions in 1627 and 1633, and was a collection of botanical illustrations of 69 of the most striking plants then available, and which Rabel had been commissioned to paint for Gaston of Orléans. Other artists later added their work, notably Nicolas Robert (1614-1685). The plates eventually numbered over 6000 and are kept in the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris. There is some doubt among scholars as to whether Rabel engraved the original 69 plates, as none of them is signed and his name only appears on the title of the third edition. By the end of the 1700s they were generally assumed to have been done by Emanuel Sweert.From 1617 until his death in 1637, Rabel was a set designer for theatres and for ballets de cour, and designed ballet costumes. He made deliberate use of a sixteenth-century tradition of the grotesque in the creation of his exaggerated comic figures, and the extreme facial distortions he uses, such as 'grotesquely swollen and disjointed necks, protruding chins, exaggerated hooked and drooping noses, and glaring, squinting eyes'. These owe a lot to the grotesque caricatures by the German artist Hans Weiditz, and the printmakers Peter Flötner and Erhard Schön. In turn, Rabel's work influenced Inigo Jones, as well as other European artists of the period. Two of Rabel's ballets were:\n\"Les Fées de la forêt de Saint-Germain\" (First performed in February 1625)\n\"Grand Ballet de la douairière de Billebahaut\" (First performed in February 1626)\"Les Fées de la forêt de Saint-Germain\" was danced at the Louvre in February 1625, with Louis XIII himself in the role of a \"valiant fighter\".Rabel was banished to Blois by Cardinal Mazarin. Here he founded the first botanical garden of the province and imported many species from the Antilles through his doctor, Brunyer. He died in Paris, but his descendants continued to live in Blois.\nHis widow, Anthoinette Guibourg, married Jacques de Bellville, a friend of the family and the King's ballet master and choreographer.\nAmong other things, he created an illuminated Bible and published a book on the arms of Germany. Like his father, Jean Rabel, he did work for the astronomer Nicolas de Peiresc, a pupil of Galileo's, and is thought to have produced the first important map of the moon, a year before his death. In 1633 Peiresc wrote to Rabel and asked him to do drawings of some antique vases.\nThe Bibliothèque nationale de France holds the originals of his \"Recueil de cent fleurs et insectes\".", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Daniel Rabel", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1578", 14]]], "3_death": [[["1637", 31]]], "4_nationality": [[["French", 55]]]}}

{"docid": "Wikipedia-08234", "doctext": "Domenico di Michelino (1417–1491) was an Italian Renaissance painter who was born and died in Florence. His real name was Domenico di Francesco. The patronymic \"di Michelino\" was adopted in honor of his teacher, the cassone painter Michelino di Benedetto (c. 1378-1499), by whom no works have been identified. Giorgio Vasari reports that Domenico was also a pupil of Fra Angelico, whose influence is reflected in many of Domenico's paintings along with that of Filippo Lippi and Pesellino.\nDomenico enrolled in the Florentine painters' confraternity, the Compagnia di San Luca, by 1442. Two years later he joined the Arte dei Medici e Speziali, the Florentine painters' guild. He had a workshop in the Via delle Terme, Florence, which he shared with Domenico di Zanobi (formerly known as the Master of the Johnson Nativity).His earliest extant work is a processional banner for the Ospedale degli Innocenti, Florence, in which the Virgin is shown protecting the martyred innocents beneath her mantle. Commissioned in 1440 and completed in 1446, the picture was entirely repainted in the sixteenth century by Michele Tosini.In 1449-50 Domenico painted the chapel of Saint Leonard in the church of Santa Maria a Peretola in the outskirts of Florence. The chapel includes a lunette with a scene of Saint Leonard Freeing Prisoners as well as images of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, Saint Lucy and musical angels.In 1458 Domenico painted an altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with Saints, now at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, and in 1463 he was commissioned an altarpiece by Cosimo de' Medici for the church of San Girolamo in Volterra (now at Volterra's Museo Diocesano). Other, undated altarpieces are in Anghiari (Santo Stefano), Dijon (Musée des Beaux-Arts), Florence (Galleria dell'Accademia), San Gimignano (Museo Civico) and San Giovanni Valdarno (Museo della Basilica di Santa Maria delle Grazie). A painting of Saint Lawrence at San Lorenzo a Porciano in Stia, painted between 1477 and 1482, is representative of Domenico's late work. In addition to altarpieces, he also made many small-scale paintings of religious subjects, painted the fronts of cassoni, and illuminated manuscripts. \nDomenico's most famous work is the Comedy Illuminating Florence on the north wall of the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, Florence. According to documents, the painting was commissioned on 30 January 1465 and was designed by Alesso Baldovinetti. It shows Dante Alighieri presenting his famous poem, the Divine Comedy, to the city of Florence. Views of Hell, Mount Purgatory and Paradise appear in the background, all as described in the poem. It has been suggested that the painting was inspired by Giovanni di Paolo's illumination for Paradiso 17 in the Yates Thompson Manuscript (c. 1444-1450; London, British Library), one of the finest Divine Comedy manuscripts ever produced, which shows all of the same details but in reverse.Domenico was still active in 1483 but few of his works from this period survive. He died in Florence on 18 April 1491 and was buried in the church of Sant'Ambrogio.The art historian Bernard Berenson mistakenly assigned all of Domenico's paintings to Giusto d'Andrea (1440-1496), and misattributed Zanobi Strozzi's paintings to Domenico di Michelino.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Domenico di Michelino", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1417", 23]]], "3_death": [[["1491", 28]]], "4_nationality": [[["Italian", 41]]]}}

According to New York Times critic Roberta Smith, Nelson has dodged the burden of a \"superficially consistent style,\" sustained by \"an adventuresome emphasis on materials\" and an athletic approach to process that builds on the work of Jackson Pollock. Writers in Art in America and Artforum credit her experimentation with influencing a younger generation of painters exploring unconventional techniques with renewed interest.

Marchant began an early, peripatetic career by late 1826 advertising his services in a Charleston, South Carolina newspaper, but returned to Edgartown in 1828-1829. He would soon after relocate to Worcester, Massachusetts, painting some of the city's prominent citizens. Marchant was active in New York City after 1832, completing many portraits of well-to-do merchants and political leaders during the 1830s and 1840s; in addition, he completed commissions in several Ohio cities as well as in Nashville and New Orleans, before settling in Philadelphia in 1854 where he would remain for another thirty years. Although mostly known for his portraits in oil, Marchant also created miniatures. He was elected to a number of arts academies and exhibited regularly during his lifetime.An ardent opponent of slavery who advocated for the return of slaves to Africa, Marchant was commissioned by the Union League of Philadelphia in December 1862 to paint a portrait of Abraham Lincoln to be displayed in Independence Hall. Marchant worked in the White House for several months in early 1863, having daily contact with the President, and ultimately depicted him seated at a table having just signed the Emancipation Proclamation. Marchant said that his painting \"triumphantly gives lie to those hideous caricatures of Mr. Lincoln\" which were at the time widely circulated in the hostile press. Authorized reproductions of Marchant's somewhat idealized portrait were widely circulated prior to the 1864 presidential election, and printed at a rate of 1,000 per day.Another 1864 Marchant portrait of Lincoln is featured today in the Lincoln Room of the President's Guest House (known as Blair House) in Washington, D.C., where it may be viewed by visiting dignitaries.

Before debuting for the Dutch national side, she played club cricket for the VRA Amsterdam women's side, and was also involved in coaching at the club, based in Amstelveen. Reynolds made her ODI debut for the Netherlands in July 1997. Her debut came at the Mikkelberg-Kunst-und-Cricket Center in Hattstedt, Germany, in the first match of the Dutch team's inaugural series against the Danish national side. A right-arm fast-medium bowler, she took 1/12 from eight overs on debut, her only wicket being Danish opener Karin Mikkelsen.Reynolds did not play the second ODI against Denmark, but was selected for all three ODIs played during the November 1997 Dutch tour of Sri Lanka, which preceded the 1997 World Cup in India. She played in only two of the five matches that the Netherlands played at the tournament, against New Zealand and Sri Lanka, with the team reaching the quarter-finals for the first and only time. Reynolds' greatest success came at the 1999 European Cricket Championship, held in Denmark. She conceded only 49 runs from 25.2 overs at the tournament, finishing with an economy rate of 1.93 runs per over. Against Denmark, she took 3/9 from 10 overs, which included five maiden overs. Despite her efforts, the Danish team won the match by three wickets, with the Dutchwomen having earlier been bowled out for 88 runs.At the 2000 World Cup, hosted by New Zealand, Reynolds played in six of the Netherlands' seven matches, missing only the game against Ireland. She bowled more overs than any other Dutch fast bowler, with only medium-pacer Teuntje de Boer and off-spinners Carolien Salomons and Caroline de Fouw bowling more than her. However, Reynolds failed to take a single wicket at the tournament, conceding 163 runs. The Dutch team's final match against Australia, an eventual finalist, was her last at ODI level. Outside of playing cricket, Reynolds is a freelance Dutch–English translator, and also a painter, having exhibited in several Amsterdam venues.\n\n\n== References ==", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Elise Reynolds", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1969", 36]]], "3_death": [], "4_nationality": [[["Dutch", 54]]]}}

He was also known simply as Giuseppe Dossena.\n\nHe attended the Brera Academy (Milan) and the Scuola del Castello (Milan), where he formed  strong friendships with  Aligi Sassu, Ernesto Treccani, Guttuso, Domenico Cantatore and Umberto Lilloni. At the Scuola del Castello he won a prize for his sculpture works (a trip to Venice), but his attraction toward color made him choose painting as the medium of artistic communication.\nAlthough his tendency toward impressionism was evident from the beginning, the necessity to provide for his family forced him to dedicate only his spare time to this aspect of the arts. He therefore earned his livelihood for many years with the restoration and the decoration of villas and castles, in addition to producing frescoes for the local churches. In the residences of Pirelli, Falck, Borletti, Invernizzi, Necchi, Toscanini, Count Cicogna, Duke  Gallarati Scotti, and Count Castelbarco, Emilio Giuseppe Dossena decorated, restored and painted large panels with mythological and archaic themes and battles. His works were also in the Italian Embassy in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, but were destroyed by air raids during WWII.\nHis passion for artistic expression allowed him to retain his creative integrity, and he became a sought after impressionist, known for the sensibility of his works as much as for the dynamic strokes which characterized them. His first solo exhibit, at the Galleria Gavioli in Milan (1943), was a success with the critics and the public, and all of the paintings were purchased by collectors.\nThe exhibit at the galleria Hoepli in Milan (1964), and the one at the Palazzo dell’Arredamento, in Desio (1967), also achieved a good response, earning a place on the prestigious Enciclopedia dell’Arte (Edizioni SEDA, Milan).\nUntil the mid-1950s, Dossena signed his paintings GDossena (for Giuseppe Dossena), but the signature mutated in E.G.Dossena after that period.\nAfter the artist lost his studio in a fire, he moved in 1968 to Brooklyn, New York, and resided at 54 Cheever Place in Carroll Gardens and was employed by Studio the Berger, restoring works by Renoir, Rembrandt, Picasso and other masters, property of museums and private collections, among which stand out the Metropolitan Museum of New York and the Playboy Club.\nIn New York, the artist temporarily abandoned his impressionist roots, embracing the neo-expressionism, creating shapes more simplified, almost essential, without any schematism or structural restrictions. The shape is almost snatched from nature, in a continued research to contain and interpret the existential essence and express these new inescapable sensations, which the artist feel away from his country.\n\nThe exhibits at the Columbus Citizens Committee (1973) and the Galerie Internationale (1973, 1974) gave unforeseen positive results. Dorothy Hall, art critic of NY Park East magazine, stated: \"These are exuberant works in rich, assertive color, dealing with varied subject matter, both abstract and representational. In either case, there's a feeling of nervous energy bursting forth in the artist's treatment of generously flowered fields, butterflies, still lifes and dancing figures …”Mario Albertazzi, the Il Progresso Italo-Americano art critic, added: \"Brilliant colorist, he brings to his canvas the light of nature and the joy of life. His works…are rich in density and at the same time buoyant, restless and gentle as a delicate caress…\"After eight years he returned to Italy, and devoted his time exclusively to painting. He regained his impressionistic tendencies, although with a more aggressive chromatic handling.\n\nDossena exhibited at the Galleria Treves (Spotorno, 1977), Galleria Il Portichetto ( Stresa, 1978) and the Circolo Ambrosiano Meneghin e Cecca (Milan, 1983). The specialized press covered these events profusely, offering only positive comments. The art critic Mario Portalupi affirmed:  “In truth, his painting process is born out of impressions and the subsequent emotions, which transform reality and regulate the chromatic entities on the canvas…”His friend Enzo Lepore, renowned opera singer, stated:  “Dossena…excels for the luminous harmony of the chromatic contrasts and he distinguishes himself for the expressive purity of his vigorous and original style… His paintings are fresh, palpitating, and rich with a vast conception and spirituality, in a frame of radiant and intensive colors…”Among the many honors he received, in 1985 Dossena was awarded the prestigious Ambrogino d’Oro per l’Arte from the City of Milan and in 1989 a ceramic tile with his signature is placed in the famous Muretto di Alassio.\nDossena was a member of numerous academies and artistic associations, among them the  Accademia Tiberina and the Accademia dei Bronzi. In the last years of his life, the artist, ill and unable to paint, devoted himself to poetry, receiving numerous awards and appearing in a variety of literary anthologies. The exhibit at the Trask Gallery of the National Arts Club of New York, organized in 1998 by the magazine L’Idea of Brooklyn in his memory, beat all the participation records and it was the first one for an Italian artist in such an institution.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Emilio Giuseppe Dossena", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1903", 38]]], "3_death": [[["1987", 55]]], "4_nationality": [[["Italian", 68]]]}}

He died April 18, 2014(2014-04-18) (aged 88).\nErik Schmidt's father, August Schmidt, a master mariner, was captain of SS Merisaar, a merchant ship owned by Merilaid & Co. Erik also hoped to become a sea captain in the future but he was also a talented amateur painter. Erik's uncle was a famous optician Bernhard Schmidt mostly known for inventing the Schmidt camera. Erik went to school in the next-door Swedish school, and after four years continued his studies at the Swedish College at Haapsalu. Erik's early paintings were noticed by Ants Laikmaa. At the age of 17 he became a teacher of the primary school where he himself had been a pupil a few years ago. This freed him from the danger of having to \"volunteer\" for service in either the Estonian Legion or the German Arbeitsdienst. At the end of October 1943 the danger from a new Soviet occupation became possible and Erik Schmidt and his parents decided to leave everything and flee to Sweden where they got a warm welcome from the ship-owning Brodin family. After World War II Erik signed on as an apprentice on the maiden voyage on a Brodin Line cargo- and passenger-liner, said to be the fastest in the world. After a year he had to leave the ship in the next Swedish port in order to fulfil his military service.\nDuring one of these visits to New York City he met the Armenian painter Ariel Agemian, who had ended his studies at the Accademia di Belle Arti of Venice with a Gold Medal, and been dubbed Knight of the Order of St. Gregory by Pope Pius XII. Agemian was a very gifted and capable teacher, who brought a complete change into Erik's seafaring life. During his voyages to South American ports, Erik Schmidt tried his hand at drawing and painting, showed the results to Ariel, and was guided and encouraged by him, until he finally decided to give up seafaring and become a painter. After a short stay in Sweden in December 1949 he studied at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts from 1950 to 1953. After a stay in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1957, he established himself in Palma de Mallorca, where he has lived and worked ever since. Erik had 5 children. In 1973 he met Kerstin Lindahl the woman he soon married, a beautiful, intelligent young woman with a strong sense of loyalty and that changed his life for ever. Kerstin is a lively bright companion . Erik discovered that he was accepted and appreciated as he was, and could now concentrate on his painting\nErik Schmidt describes his philosophy of seeing and painting:\n\nYou must keep in mind, that there is beauty all around us,  .  and that it is the painter who has to discover it and be able to reproduce what he sees, in order to bring enjoyment to everybody else.\nErik Schmidt is a gifted portraitist, he also paints scenes and people from rural areas busy with their everyday toils. Erik Schmidt paints with Rubens' medium, based on the black oil and mastix solution, which allowed him to use paints with brilliant colours that blended well and had good drying qualities and which he has used ever since. His colours, which until his time in Paris had been the greys and ochres of the coastal scenes of his childhood in Estonia, plus the changing colours of the sky and the sea, are now enriched by more brilliant colours used by his fellow-students from India and from Arabic countries.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Erik Schmidt", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1925", 24]]], "3_death": [[["2014", 75]]], "4_nationality": [[["Estonian", 852], ["German", 875], ["Swedish", 512]]]}}

Like his sister Anna, Eugène Boch spent a large part of the funds, which they owed to their father's, Victor Boch, business success, on promoting other artists. They bought pictures from virtually all leading contemporaries of their time, the majority of whom were also their friends.\nUpon Eugène Boch's death in 1941, he bequeathed The Poet – that is Van Gogh's title for his portrait of Eugène Boch, which Boch received from Johanna van Gogh-Bonger in accordance to the last will of Vincent and Theo – to the Louvre. Today the painting can be seen in the Paris Musée d'Orsay.\nPart of his collection was bought by his great nephew Luitwin von Boch with the idea to make a Museum on Anna and Eugene Boch.\nThe Eugene Boch website is maintained from the Cremerie de Paris at the Hôtel de Villeroy.

He was born in Stockholm, the son of a railway official, Ernst Lundquist and Olga Eugenia Maria Charlotta Lundquist (born Björck). Lundquist, byway of his mother's family, was a relative of famed singer Johanna Maria \"Jenny\" Lind and the painter Oscar Björck. He was the youngest of the three children; his brother Edvard was born in 1898 and sister Elsa in 1902. The family home was located in Stockholm at 9 Tegnérgatan. His early life has been described as middle class, proper and calm.Lundquist had bouts of depression and illness which caused delays in his education. His depression was often exacerbated by the long and dark months of autumn in Sweden. Lundquist had experienced feelings of \"gloom\" as early as 1920. By 1929, he had entered into a rest home on the island of Lidingö to recuperate. Recurring depression, primarily during the autumn season, will become a reoccurring event in Lundquist's life. These personal adversities were generally unknown to the public as Lundquist created a public narrative that presented him in a style that he favored. His desire to obscure and hide the unpleasant and uncontrolled aspects of his life has led to suggestions of a parallel/corollary to his artwork.He lived and worked in Saltsjö-Duvnäs, on the outskirts of Stockholm. Here during the late 1940s and early 1950s, Evert Lundquist along with his wife and fellow artist Ebba Reutercrona, joined artists Roland Kempe and Staffan Hallström in living together at Olle Nyman's family home in Saltsjö-Duvnäs. This grouping of artists began to be identified as the \"Saltsjö-Duvnäs Group\". The group was rather loosely based and followed no set ideology or philosophical premise. They were, however, centered on an exploration of the material nature of painting, \"from the small perspective, with the point of departure in the poetry of rural everyday life.\"In the first part of the 1980s, a gradual deterioration in Lundquist's vision began leading him to paint less. Lundquist used labels with very large text attached to his tubes of paint in order to facilitate his recognition of the colors they contained. This helped the artist to eliminate any errors in his work, which was of critical importance as his limited eyesight forced him to finish any painting in one single session. The last known paintings by  Lundquist occurred in 1989/1990.In 1984, Lundquist published his autobiography, From the Life of a Painter (in Swedish \"Ur ett Målarliv\"). The autobiography reaffirmed much of his personal \"narrative\" which Lundquist preferred to share publicly.\nEvert Ernst Erland Olof Lundquist died on 4 November 1994.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Evert Lundquist", 1458]]], "2_birth": [[["1904", 43]]], "3_death": [[["1994", 72]]], "4_nationality": [[["Swedish", 95]]]}}

The standard author abbreviation Woolward is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.Miss Woolward was a freelance artist and the daughter of Reverend Woolward. She lived in Belton, Lincolnshire and through the Talbot Sisters was commissioned by Schomberg to paint orchids and fungi from Newbattle Abbey and Monteviot House. She received no formal training as artist or botanist, but on completion of the project for Schomberg, she worked at the Natural History museum.\n\"The Genus Masdevallia\" is considered one of the finest illustrated orchid books of the Victorian age. The Marquess had a boundless passion for orchids, in particular the Andean Masdevallias of which he had a sizeable collection at Newbattle Abbey in Scotland. Most of these came from Friedrich Carl Lehmann, who was a regular advertiser in the pages of \"The Gardeners' Chronicle\". Pressed flowers from Newbattle Abbey are still preserved at the Natural History Museum. Spending some ten years on visits to Newbattle Abbey, Florence depicted more than 350 orchids, of which 85 were Masdevallias.\nAfter having problems in finding a professional botanist to write the text accompanying each plate, Florence decided to write it herself, no doubt helped by British Museum botanists on her frequent visits there. The work appeared in nine parts between 1891 and 1896, each part with ten plates and text, the final part having only seven plates. The parts were priced at £1 10s each, a total of £13 10s for the set. Each species has detailed notes on its habitat in the Andes, and these were written by Lehmann. Some of his original, hand-written descriptions are in possession of his family in Popayán, as well as a letter from Miss Woolward. The plates were lithographed by Florence herself – the hand-coloured plates depict all the Masdevallia species at life-size. Originally 250 copies were planned, but it appears that only 150 were actually issued, with 100 being bound. In the introduction Florence touches upon her involvement in the book's preparation for publication: \"It is no doubt advantageous in botanical work … that the person who makes the original drawing from nature should also lithograph the plates and indicate the colours to be used by the colorist, for, by this means, the work passes through fewer hands and is more likely to turn out accurate. I have therefore pursued this method throughout the present work, and have, besides, touched up the colouring of every plate sent out, numbering nearly 9,000\" Bound volumes of Woolward's paintings of orchids and fungi remain with the heirs of the Marquess. Her later works for the Natural History Museum are showpieces of draughtsmanship and botanical accuracy. Her work on elms and poplars concluded in about 1908, and her landscapes somewhat earlier. From then, it would appear, that she produced no further works.\nAfter publication of \"The Genus Masdevallia\" some original plates remained in the possession of the Woolward family, but their whereabouts remained unknown. They were finally found in the care of two of Florence's great nieces living on the Welsh Borders. The contents of an old trunk included not only the plates, but also \"framed photographs, hand-painted china, and memorabilia\". The folio of paintings was donated to Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, joining Florence's original vignettes which had been donated to Kew by Rev. Spenser A.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-12053", "doctext": "Baron Friedrich von Kleudgen, sometimes known by his nickname Fritz, was born in Germany and studied painting in Weimar. He later moved to the Academy of Art Dresden where he met Adrian Ludwig Richter. Like many artists of his time, he visited Italy, with extended stays in Naples and Venice.In 1873 he arrived in Bordighera with his wife and stayed at the Pensione Calvauna, which later became Coffee Cadama, until 1884. In the city he found a small German community and fascinated by the climate and light, decided to settle in the Ligurian town. In 1885 he built his home just outside the walls of old Bordighera, near the port of Magdalena and the old cemetery. The house, which he named \"Villa Banana\", and that is on the 4th of Via dei Colli, still exists today but unfortunately it was turned into an apartment building and is in poor conditions.In 1891 he married his second wife, Elizabeth Pudmensky. They had three children: Frieda, William (mountaineer who died in 1929) and Luise who died in 1898. The only surviving child was Baroness Frieda von Kleudgen Peano, who in 1971 wrote a book on her father's life, \"My father\". The daughter remembers that on the terrace of the house in the summer evenings, von Kleudgen often fiddled with bordigotti friends including the painter and Mayor GF Piana. The father loved the simple life of the village and often spoke with fishermen returning from the Bay dell'Arziglia.\nWhat fascinated him was the sea, which he painted in numerous paintings. His paintings portray him now calm, now stormy, conveying the full force of nature. His most famous paintings are the \"fish's Nest\" and the \"Sea Serpent\" which can be seen at the Bicknell Museum. Some of his paintings are on display at the Town hall of Bordighera but the majority is in private collections. Another subject he liked to paint were the paths of Bordighera.He also had close ties of friendship with numerous bordigotti of different welfare states and represented them in his paintings. He was a friends of the other painters and artists who lived in Bordighera as Pompeo Mariani, Giuseppe Ferdinando Piana, Hermann Nestel, Charles Garnier and of course Ludwig Winter.\nIn 1884 Claude Monet portrayed him while he painted a window of Villa Garnier. Kleudgen reproduced in a series of watercolors the bordigotti he liked so much. Some of these works became popular because they were taken up in postcards of the time.He died in Bordighera on June 22, 1924, at the age of 68 years.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Friederich von Kleudgen", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1856", 0]]], "3_death": [[["1924", 2460]]], "4_nationality": [[["German", 81]]]}}

The son of the landscape painter Jacob Gauermann (1773–1843), he was born at Miesenbach near Gutenstein in Lower Austria. He was an early representative of the Veristic style devoted to nature in all its diversity.It was the intention of his father that Gauermann should devote himself to agriculture, but the example of an elder brother, who, however, died early, fostered his inclination towards art. Under his father's direction he began studies in landscape, and he also diligently copied the works of the chief masters in animal painting which were contained in the academy and court library of Vienna. In the summer he made art tours in the districts of Styria, Tirol, and Salzburg.\nTwo animal pieces which he exhibited at the Vienna Exhibition of 1824 were regarded as remarkable productions for his years, and led to his receiving commissions in 1825 and 1826 from Prince Metternich and Caraman, the French ambassador. His reputation was greatly increased by his picture The Storm, exhibited in 1829, and from that time his works were much sought after and obtained correspondingly high prices. His Field Labourer was regarded by many as the most noteworthy picture in the Vienna exhibition of 1834, and his numerous animal pieces have entitled him to a place in the first rank of painters of that class of subjects.\nThe peculiarity of his pictures is the representation of human and animal figures in connexion with appropriate landscapes and in characteristic situations so as to manifest nature as a living whole, and he particularly excels in depicting the free life of animals in wild mountain scenery. Along with great mastery of the technicalities of his art, his works exhibit patient and keen observation, free and correct handling of details, and bold and clear colouring. He died at Vienna on 7 July 1862.\nMany of his pictures have been engraved, and after his death a selection of fifty-three of his works was prepared for this purpose by the Austrian Kunstverein (Art Union).\nHis art has influenced among others the works of Joseph Heicke.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Friedrich Gauermann", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1807", 34]]], "3_death": [[["1862", 64]]], "4_nationality": [[["Austrian", 77]]]}}

Therefore, he worked as an independent painter and art teacher in Solingen for some years.Influenced by late Cubism and Alfred Manessier, he created abstract paintings, but he also produced portraits and wall paintings. Beginning in 1937 he made stained glass windows, immersing private, public and church rooms in colored light in an innovative manner, based on an interaction of color, form and line, for which he would become famous. \"To bring the colour to floating, to detect meditative spaces and to conquer a depth of the painting directed towards transcendence has been his artistic programme.\" One example, installed in 1957, is to be found in Berlin's Kaiser-Friedrich-Gedächtniskirche. In 1976, he designed four windows for the Collegio Teutonico, Rome. Another important work is his new design for St. Gereon's Basilica, Cologne (1979-1986), which he called \"my religious testament and climax of my lifework\". The Stained Glass Association of America considers Meistermann \"the most versatile German stained glass designer\".In 1953 the artist was appointed professor at the Städelschule, Frankfurt am Main. From 1955 to 1959 he hold a professorship at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, and from 1960 to 1976 he was a professor at the Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden Künste Karlsruhe.

Among his students at the Karlsruhe Academy were Gerold Bursian, Wolfgang Glöckler, Otto Mindhoff, K.J. Overkott and Hans-Günther van Look.\nMeistermann participated at the documentas I (1955) and II (1959) in Kassel.\nA devout Catholic, Meistermann worked for sacred rooms with great passion. With his art he wanted to praise the grace of God, looking for form-expressing solutions to glorify the Creator. However, he also criticized the Church, quarreling with those who thought they were in a position to claim special rights only because they administered the Christian faith: \"I make propaganda for the Christian faith,\" he said, \"but quite certainly, I do not make propaganda for the Church.\"From 1967 to 1972, he was President of the German Artists Federation, requesting his colleagues in numerous papers and speeches to contribute their part to a more humane society.In 1994, the Georg-Meistermann-Museum was opened in Wittlich.\n\n\n== References ==", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Georg Meistermann", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1911", 28]]], "3_death": [[["1990", 56]]], "4_nationality": [[["German", 79]]]}}

In a desire to both educate and provide Christian art to new converts, Valignano wrote to Rome requesting an accomplished Christian artist who could both produce art for his mission as well as teach students. Giovanni Niccolò arrived in Japan in 1583 \"and began to train students, including Watano Mâncio, Mâncio João and Pedro João.

The Painting School's students included not only Japanese, but also Europeans and Chinese who were taught a variety of techniques ranging from oil to watercolours. Examples of its students' works were shipped to Rome as proof of its success.\nThe school would become the largest school of Western painting in Asia. While there, Niccolò also created devotional objects for use by Japanese Catholic churches and converts. His preferred images were primarily the Salvator Mundi and Madonna. No known works remain that can be positively attributed to Giovanni Niccolò, although a tentative identification of an oil sketch of the Virgin and Child currently in an Osaka collection has been made.Although the school had to relocate several times to avoid persecution, it was eventually exiled from Japan less than three decades later when the last missionaries were expelled from Japan in 1614.

Olga's relationship with her mother, Empress Marie, the daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark, was strained and distant from childhood. In contrast, she and her father were close. He died when she was 12, and her brother Nicholas became emperor.\nIn 1901, at 19, she married Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, who was privately believed by family and friends to be homosexual. Their marriage of 15 years remained unconsummated, and Peter at first refused Olga's request for a divorce. The couple led separate lives and their marriage was eventually annulled by the Emperor in October 1916. The following month Olga married cavalry officer Nikolai Kulikovsky, with whom she had fallen in love several years before. During the First World War, the Grand Duchess served as an army nurse and was awarded a medal for personal gallantry. At the downfall of the Romanovs in the Russian Revolution of 1917, she fled with her husband and children to Crimea, where they lived under the threat of assassination. Her brother Nicholas and his family were shot by revolutionaries.\nOlga escaped revolutionary Russia with her second husband and their two sons in February 1920. They joined her mother, the Dowager Empress, in Denmark. In exile, Olga acted as companion and secretary to her mother, and was often sought out by Romanov impostors who claimed to be her dead relatives. She met Anna Anderson, the best-known impostor, in Berlin in 1925. After the Dowager Empress's death in 1928, Olga and her husband purchased a dairy farm in Ballerup, near Copenhagen. She led a simple life: raising her two sons, working on the farm and painting. During her lifetime, she painted over 2,000 works of art, which provided extra income for both her family and the charitable causes she supported.\nIn 1948, feeling threatened by Joseph Stalin's regime, Olga and her immediate family relocated to a farm in Campbellville, Ontario, Canada. With advancing age, Olga and her husband moved to a bungalow near Cooksville, Ontario. Colonel Kulikovsky died there in 1958.

One text entitled \"The Lofty Message of Forest and Streams\" (Linquan Gaozhi 林泉高致) is attributed to him. The work covers a variety of themes centered on the appropriate way of painting a landscape. He was a court professional, a literatus, well-educated painter who developed an incredibly detailed system of idiomatic brushstrokes which became important for later painters. One of his most famous works is Early Spring, dated 1072. The work demonstrates his innovative techniques for producing multiple perspectives which he called \"the angle of totality.\" This type of visual representation is also called \"Floating Perspective\", a technique which displaces the static eye of the viewer and highlights the differences between Chinese and Western modes of spatial representation.\nThe following is an excerpt from his treatise, \"mountains and waters\":\n\nThe clouds and the vapours of real landscapes are not the same at the four seasons. In spring they are light and diffused, in summer     rich and dense, in autumn scattered and thin, in winter dark and solitary. When such effects can be seen in pictures, the clouds and vapours have an air of life. The mist around the mountains is not the same at the four seasons. The mountains in spring are light and seductive as if smiling: the mountains in summer have a blue-green colour which seems to be spread over them; the mountains in autumn are bright and tidy as if freshly painted; the mountains in winter are sad and tranquil as if sleeping.\nGuo Xi was often referred to as a \"Northern Song master\" when it came to painting. His work inspired many later artists and he even had landscapes dedicated to him. His lesser-known \"Deep Valley\" scroll painting depicts a serene mountain valley covered with snow and several trees struggling to survive on precipitous cliffs. The ink washes and amorphous brush strokes are employed to model surfaces that suggest the veiling effects of the atmosphere. One of Guo Xi’s techniques was to layer ink washes to build up forms and his \"Deep Valley\" is a masterpiece of the use of light ink and magnificent composition.His son later described how Guo Xi approached his work: \"On days when he was going to paint, he would seat himself at a clean table, by a bright window, burning incense to right and left. He would choose the finest brushes, the most exquisite ink; wash his hands, and clean the ink-stone, as though he were expecting a visitor of rank.

His career spanned two generations and two continents, and is considered to have both preceded and influenced Abstract Expressionism. Born and educated near Munich, he was active in the early twentieth-century European avant-garde and brought a deep understanding and synthesis of Symbolism, Neo-impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism when he emigrated to the United States in 1932. Hofmann's painting is characterized by its rigorous concern with pictorial structure and unity, spatial illusionism, and use of bold color for expressive means. The influential critic Clement Greenberg considered Hofmann's first New York solo show at Peggy Guggenheim’s Art of This Century in 1944 (along with Jackson Pollock’s in late 1943) as a breakthrough in painterly versus geometric abstraction that heralded abstract expressionism. In the decade that followed, Hofmann's recognition grew through numerous exhibitions, notably at the Kootz Gallery, culminating in major retrospectives at the Whitney Museum of American Art (1957) and Museum of Modern Art (1963), which traveled to venues throughout the United States, South America, and Europe. His works are in the permanent collections of major museums around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Tate Modern, Germanisches Nationalmuseum, National Gallery of Art, and Art Institute of Chicago.Hofmann is also regarded as one of the most influential art teachers of the 20th century. He established an art school in Munich in 1915 that built on the ideas and work of Cézanne, the Cubists and Kandinsky; some art historians suggest it was the first modern school of art anywhere. After relocating to the United States, he reopened the school in both New York City and Provincetown, Massachusetts until he retired from teaching in 1958 to paint full-time. His teaching had a significant influence on post-war American avant-garde artists—including Helen Frankenthaler, Nell Blaine, Lee Krasner, Joan Mitchell, Louise Nevelson, and Larry Rivers, among many—as well as on the theories of Greenberg, in his emphasis on the medium, picture plane, and unity of the work. Some of Hofmann's other key tenets include his push/pull spatial theories, his insistence that abstract art has its origin in nature, and his belief in the spiritual value of art. Hofmann died of a heart attack in New York City on February 17, 1966.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Hans Hofmann", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1880", 24]]], "3_death": [[["1966", 44]]], "4_nationality": [[["American", 68], ["German", 56]]]}}

His father initially worked at Robert Koch's Berlin institute (the Robert Koch Institute) and then relocated to Bern in Switzerland with his family in 1906. There Kolle also received some instruction in painting and drawing.In 1917, the family moved to Frankfurt where Wilhelm Kolle became director of the Royal Institute for Experimental Therapy (now the Paul Ehrlich Institute). In 1918 Helmut Kolle met his business partner, lover, and mentor Wilhelm Uhde, an art collector, and moved with him to Weimar. After early experiences as a fledgling writer, Kolle shifted his focus more and more to painting, getting instruction from Erna Pinner in 1918/19, made possible by Uhde's connections in the art world.In 1923, Uhde hosted the first show of Kolle's paintings at his art gallery in Berlin. In 1924, Kolle and Uhde moved to Paris, where Kolle was heavily influenced by the works of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. A very successful exhibition followed in 1925, which even had a poem by Jean Cocteau about one of the paintings in the catalog. At a 1926 exhibition, almost all paintings shown were also sold, and around this time Helmut Kolle began signing his paintings as \"Kolle\" instead of using his earlier pseudonym \"Helmut vom Hügel\" (which is a complex pun based on the fact that the Latin word colle, which sounds like Kolle, is the ablative of collis, \"hill\", and can mean \"from the hill\" when combined with an appropriate preposition—which then translates back to German as vom Hügel). In 1926, Uhde moved to Chantilly, where he was later joined by Kolle in 1928 when the latter's health deteriorated.Kolle had been suffering from endocarditis since 1922. In the summer of 1931, his health problems got worse and he died in November that year. He was interred at the Cimetière du Bois de Bourillon in Chantilly.Kolle's works, insofar as they depict people, tend to feature either males, often in various states of undress or slightly suggestive poses, either (in his earlier works) very feminine-looking boys or (later in his career) decidedly muscular men, the shift probably influenced by the ideals of masculinity as found in novels by Henry de Montherlant. Despite these fairly obvious homoerotic sentiments in his paintings, Kolle was notoriously guarded about his homosexuality and his relationship with Uhde, much different to the openness of other homosexual artists in France or Germany at the time, e.g. Klaus Mann.After Kolle's death, major exhibitions of his works took place in Hamburg (1952 and 2011), Chemnitz (2010), and Munich (1994), in addition to numerous exhibitions in smaller European galleries. In England, Lucy Wertheim was the most important exponent of Kolle's œuvre, exhibiting Kolle's paintings in her London gallery in 1930, 1931, 1934, 1935, and 1938.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Helmut Kolle", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1899", 26]]], "3_death": [[["1931", 45]]], "4_nationality": [[["German", 57]]]}}

{"docid": "Wikipedia-15885", "doctext": "Henry Benbridge (October 1743  – February 1812) was an early American portrait painter. He was born in Philadelphia, the only child of James and Mary (Clark) Benbridge. When he was seven years old, his mother, who had been left a widow, was married to Thomas Gordon, a wealthy Scot. The boy's artistic talent was encouraged. He made decorative designs for his stepfather's drawing-room which were much admired. When he was fourteen years old he may have watched John Wollaston paint Gordon's portrait. It has been plausibly argued that young Benbridge had instruction from Wollaston, since his earliest known portrait, that of his half-sister Rebecca Gordon, \"seems to hark back to Wollaston.\" When he was 21, Benbridge was sent to Italy, where he studied with Pompeo Batoni and Anton Raphael Mengs. In 1769, on commission from James Boswell, biographer of Dr. Samuel Johnson, he made a portrait of Pasquale Paoli in Corsica which he took to London. It was exhibited (1769) at the Free Society of Artists, and from it three mezzotints were scraped and published with the artist's name signed \"Bembridge.\" Like other young Americans he was encouraged by Benjamin West. He wrote, on December 7, 1769, to his stepfather: \"Upon my arrival I waited upon Mr. West who received me with a sort of brotherly affection, as did my cousin, Mrs. West.\" Impelled, apparently, by a longing to rejoin his family, he left England in 1770, bearing from West the following note of recommendation to Francis Hopkinson: \"By Mr. Benbridge you will receive these few lines. You will find him an Ingenous artist and an agreeable Companion. His merit in the art must procure him great incouragement and much esteem. I deare say it will give you great pleasure to have an ingenous artist resident amongst you.\"\nIn Philadelphia Benbridge married Hetty Sage and was admitted on January 18, 1771, to membership in the American Philosophical Society, of which Benjamin Franklin was a founder. He painted the large portrait of the Gordon family, with six figures, one of his masterpieces. Suffering, however, from asthma, he sought a more congenial climate and moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where he succeeded Jeremiah Theus (d. May 18, 1774) as the popular portrait painter of South Carolina. There he made many likenesses of southern men and women, several of which have been popularly attributed to John Singleton Copley, an artist who never painted in the South and who left America in 1774. Around 1800 Benbridge settled in Norfolk, Virginia, whence he made frequent visits to his native city. At Norfolk he gave to Thomas Sully his first lessons in oil painting. He had previously instructed Thomas Coram of Charleston. Sully describes his master as \"a portly man of good address–gentlemanly in his deportment.\" Benbridge's health is said by Hart to have declined in middle age. Dunlap's assertion that his last years were passed \"in obscurity and poverty\" has been disputed.\nAs a technician Benbridge drew well and painted solidly, exhibiting many characteristics of the late Italian masters. His contemporary Charles Fraser (quoted by Dunlap) said that \"his shadows were dark and opaque and more suitable to the historical style.\" Hart says \"Benbridge was impregnated by the brownish sameness of Batoni's palette and his shadows were too opaque, and although later he was somewhat emancipated from these errors, all his work belongs to the late Italian school.\" His paintings, nevertheless, were notably good in respect of their black-and-white values and some of his miniatures are exquisite. His Italianate mode was much appreciated in the Mid-Atlantic and Southern states during his lifetime.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Henry Benbridge", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1744", 0]]], "3_death": [[["1812", 42]]], "4_nationality": [[["American", 61]]]}}

He was an important representative of constructivism.\nGlöckner was born in Cotta near Dresden. He attended the vocational school in Leipzig in 1903 and worked as a designer for textiles. From 1904 to 1911 he attended the evening classes at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Dresden, where he became friends with Kurt Fiedler. Among their lectures were Oskar Seyffert and Carl Rade, who later was a renowned professor at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts and remained a friend of Glöckner for many years. Glöckner was mainly interested in drawings, but also in projections and geometry. From 1914 to 1918 he served in infantry divisions in France, Russia, and Poland.\nAfter World War I, Glöckner earned some money with the copying of paintings for the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister. At the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts he studied with Otto Gussmann from 1923 to 1924. Hans Grundig was among his fellow students. His experimental style, however, did not find everyone's appreciation and Glöckner left the academy again. As a freelancer he turned to constructivism ever deeper during the following years. In 1932 he became a member of the re-founded Dresdner Sezession. The Nazis refused him any opportunities to exhibit and sell his paintings and graphics. So he turned to sgraffito to earn his living.\nGlöckner lost his home during the bombing of Dresden in World War II and moved to Loschwitz. Because of his formalist style, the officials of the GDR refused him the appreciation he deserved for a long time. His rehabilitation began with an exhibition of his graphical work in the Kupferstichkabinett, Dresden in 1969. In 1979 he received a permanent visa for the Federal Republic of Germany. Finally, in 1984, he was awarded with the National Prize of the GDR and the DEFA dedicated a film to him. Centrally in the area of the Technische Universität Dresden he was allowed to erect a sculpture, which had been banned just a few years before. Another sculpture was erected one year later in the park of the Hotel Bellevue, Dresden's first address that time.\nIn his later years Glöckner regularly visited West Berlin, where his cohabitee lived and where he died in 1987. Glöckner's urn was entombed in Loschwitz.

She separated from her husband in 1891 and earned a living making waistcoats.\nIn 1894, she met the painter François Joseph Girot and began living with him in Paris as his lover. The next year, she met Jules Flandrin, another painter and a student of Gustave Moreau. The two fell in love, and Vallet left Girot to move in with Flandrin in Rue Campagne-Première, in the Montparnasse area. She would live with him as his companion for 20 years.Vallet's first works were rejected from the 1900 Salon des Indépendants, but she succeeded in having a dozen paintings shown in that exhibition the following year, under the pseudonym of Jacqueline Marval. The art dealer Ambroise Vollard bought them all.\nIn 1902, several of her paintings were displayed alongside works by Flandrin, Albert Marquet, and Henri Matisse in a gallery in Rue Victor-Massé curated by Berthe Weill, who was particularly interested in promoting the works of female artists living in Paris.\nIn 1911, Marval was chosen by a jury made up of Gabriel Astruc, the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle, and the painters Maurice Denis and Édouard Vuillard to decorate the foyer of the new Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. She created a series of twelve paintings on the theme of Daphnis and Chloe, completing them in 1913. The same year, she protested against the removal from the Salon d'Automne of Kees van Dongen's The Spanish Shawl, and became friends with van Dongen, setting up her studio near his.\nIn 1913, Francis Picabia displayed Marval's 1903 painting The Odalisques in the Armory Show, an important exhibition of modern art in New York. This painting depicted five women: three seated nude, one dressed and reclining on her elbow, and one standing and holding a tray. Guillaume Apollinaire wrote of this painting in the Chronique des arts that \"Mme. Marval has given the measure of her talent and has achieved a work of importance for modern painting.\" The same painting was displayed at the July 1916 Salon d'Antin organized by the poet André Salmon, beside Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.\nMarval's works began to be recognized across Europe; she exhibited in Basel, Barcelona, Oslo, the Venice Biennale, Winterthur, and Zurich. However, she lost interest in painting after several years; rather, she liked to dance, dress as a \"précieuse ridicule\", dye her hair red, and wear green hats which she made herself. She was given the epithet \"the fairy of the Belle Époque.\"\nBeginning in 1923, Marval was active in favor of the creation of modern art museums in Paris and Grenoble. She died in Paris in 1932; after her death, her works were held in the galerie Druet before it was closed in 1938 and they were sold.

Before he turned twenty he went to Paris to study in veterinary school to make himself fully acquainted with the anatomy of horses and other animals. He seems to have subsequently returned to Switzerland. The Tübinger Morgenblatt (1808, p. 876) says that \"Agasse, the celebrated animal painter, now in England, owed his fortune to an accident. About eight years ago, he being then in Switzerland, a rich Englishman (George Pitt, later Lord Rivers) asked him to paint his favourite dog (greyhound) which had died. The Englishman was so pleased with his work that he took the painter to England with him.\"\nNagler says that he was one of the most celebrated animal painters at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century. In Johann Georg Meusel's Neue Miscellaneen (viii. 1052 et seq.), he compares Agasse and Wouwermans, wholly in favour of the former. In that partial article much is said of his extreme devotion to art, of his marvelous knowledge of anatomy, of his special fondness for the English racehorses, and his excellence in depicting them. He appears first in the Academy catalogues in 1801 as the exhibitor of the 'Portrait of a Horse', and continued to exhibit more or less until 1845 (contradicting Nagler's statement that he died \"about\" 1806).\nIn the catalogues his name is given as J.L. Agasse or Agassé. The number of times Agassé changed his address confirms Redgrave's assertion that \"he lived poor and died poor\". The writer of the panegyric already quoted says, however, that he did not work for money, but that he was urged forward by the resistless force of natural genius.\nHe is also featured in the French thriller L'Antiquaire, with some works credited to him—a painting of two Leopards, among others.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Jacques-Laurent Agasse", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1767", 34]]], "3_death": [[["1849", 54]]], "4_nationality": [[["Swiss", 0]]]}}

{"docid": "Wikipedia-17851", "doctext": "James Sharples (4 September 1825 – 13 June 1893) was an English blacksmith and self-taught artist and engraver. He is best known for his work  The Forge, which he painted and then engraved in his spare time.\nSharples was born in Wakefield, West Riding of Yorkshire, into a large family of thirteen. His father was a blacksmith, as were both of his grandfathers. Sharples had little formal education and began to work as a smithy-boy in an iron foundry aged ten, later moving to work as a riveter in the engine shop where his father worked.\nHe discovered his artistic bent by helping the foreman to draw the designs for boilers on the workshop floor, and practised by copying lithographs and engravings in his spare time. Aged 16, he attended a drawing class at Bury Mechanics' Institution each week for three months. He learnt technique from John Burnet's Practical Treatise on Painting, asking his family to help him to read it, and then John Flaxman's Anatomical Principles and Brook Taylor's Principles of Perspective. He made his own easel and palette to attempt oil painting, walking the 18-mile round trip to Manchester to buy paint. He sold his first successful painting, a copy of an engraving entitled Sheep-shearing, for half a crown (12½p).\n\nAfter completing a few other works, he began his masterwork, The Forge, a lively depiction of the Industrial Revolution in progress that showed the interior of a large workshop at an iron foundry. He completed the work after about three years, sometime around 1849. Encouraged by its reception, Sharples gave up his day job to paint full-time, taking commissions to paint portraits, but found it difficult to make a living as an artist and returned to ironworking. Sharples took up a suggestion from a picture dealer in Manchester to have The Forge engraved, but was determined to teach himself the process and produce a steel engraving himself. After working in his spare time for about five years, often kept company in the evening by his wife's reading, he completed the task in 1859. Both the engraving and a mezzotint version became popular and sold well, but made Sharples little money. He painted one other large work, The Smithy, and was awarded a prize by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers for creating an emblematic design. His \"perseverance and industry\", and determination to improve himself, were given as an example by Samuel Smiles in his 1859 book Self-Help,  and a biography was published by local journalist Joseph Baron in 1893.\nHis works are perhaps unique examples of fine art produced by a working man in the mid-19th century, at a time when other artists were creating their impressions of labour, such as Ford Madox Brown's painting Work.\nHe married Sarah Moore on 7 April 1852. After her death in 1861, he married Sarah Ford on 20 June 1863. He had one son and one daughter with each of his wives. He died in Blackburn, Lancashire on 13 June 1893 aged 67.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["James Sharples", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1825", 28]]], "3_death": [[["1893", 43]]], "4_nationality": [[["British", 0]]]}}

At an early age he was intended for the priesthood, and placed under the care of the brothers Lamennais, but his strong desire to become a painter finally triumphed over family opposition, and in 1840 he left Plouha for Paris—his sole resources being a pension of five hundred francs, granted him for one year only by the municipality of his native town.At Paris Hamon received valuable advice and encouragement from Paul Delaroche and Charles Gleyre, and in 1848 he made his appearance at the Salon with \"Le Tombeau du Christ\" (Musée de Marseille), and a decorative work, Dessus de Porte. The works which he exhibited in 1849 Une Affiche romaine, L'Égalité au sérail, and Perroquet jasant avec deux jeunes filles obtained no marked success.His lack of success led Hamon to accept a job as a designree in the Sèvres porcelein factory, but an enamelled casket designed by him attracted notice at the London International Exhibition of 1851. He received a medal, and, inspired by his success, left his post to try his chances again at the Salon of 1852. \"La Comédie humaine\", which he then exhibited, turned the tide of his fortune, and Ma sœur n'y est pas (purchased by the emperor Napoleon III) obtained for its author a third-class medal in 1853. At the Paris International Exhibition of 1855, when Hamon re-exhibited the casket of 1851, together with several vases and pictures of which L'Amour et son troupeau, Ce n'est pas moi, and Une Gardeuse d'enfants were the most important, he received a second class medal, and the ribbon of the legion of honor.In the following year he was absent in the East, and in 1857 he reappeared with Boutique à quatre sous, Papillon enchaîné, Cantharide esclave, Dévideuses, etc., in all ten pictures; L'Amour en visite was contributed to the Salon of 1859, and Vierge de Lesbos, Tutelle, La Volière, L'Escamoteur and La Sœur aînée were all seen in 1861.Hamon now spent some time in Italy, chiefly at Capri, whence in 1864 he sent to Paris L'Aurore and Un Jour de fiançailles. The influence of Italy was also evident in Les Muses à Pompéi, his sole contribution to the Salon of 1866, a work which enjoyed great popularity and was re-exhibited at the International Exhibition of 1867, together with, La Promenade and six other pictures of previous years.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-19071", "doctext": "Born on 16 June 1935 in Cincinnati, Ohio, Jim Dine is a seminal and prolific contemporary artist whose œuvre extends over sixty years. Dine’s exceptionally diverse practice includes painting, drawing, printmaking (in many forms including lithographs, etchings, gravure, intaglio, woodcuts, letterpress and linocuts), sculpture and photography; his early works encompassed assemblage and happenings, while in recent years his poetry output, both in publications and readings, has increased. Dine has been associated with numerous art movements throughout his career including Neo-Dada (use of collage and found objects), Abstract Expressionism (the gestural nature of his painting), and Pop Art (affixing everyday objects including tools, rope, articles of clothing and even a bathroom sink) to his canvases, yet he has actively avoided such classifications. At the core of his art, regardless of the medium of the specific work, lies an intense process of autobiographical reflection, a relentless exploration and criticism of the self through a number of highly personal motifs which include: the heart, the bathrobe, tools, antique sculpture, and the character of Pinocchio (among flora, skulls, birds and figurative self-portraits). Dine’s approach is all-encompassing, incorporating his entire lived experience: “Dine’s art has a stream of consciousness quality to its evolution, and is based on all aspects of his life—what he is reading, objects he comes upon in souvenir shops around the world, a serious study of art from every time and place that he understands as being useful to his own practice.” Dine’s art has been the subject of more than 300 solo exhibitions, including retrospectives at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1970), the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1978), Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (1984–85), Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park, Grand Rapids, Michigan (2011) and Museum Folkwang, Essen (2015–16). His work is held in permanent collections including the Art Institute of Chicago; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Musée National d’Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Solomon R.

Dine’s distinctions include his nomination as a member of the Academy of Arts and Letters in New York (1980), Commandeur de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (2003), the British Museum Medal (2015) following his donation of 234 prints to the museum in 2014, membership of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome (2017), and Chevalier de l’Ordre de la Légion d’Honneur (2018).", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Jim Dine", 42]]], "2_birth": [[["1935", 16]]], "3_death": [], "4_nationality": [[["American", 1726]]]}}

He began his artistic studies at the St. Louis School of Art before leaving in 1885; he traveled to Paris, where he enrolled in the Académie Julian. During this time he was accepted at the Paris Salon, showing work there in 1886 and again in 1887. In 1888 he painted Brutality, depicting a workman beating his horse, a common sight in Parisian streets at the time; the painting was shown at the Salon of 1888, and is widely considered his masterpiece. It is currently owned by the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. Patrick also  exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in 1889, where Brutality won a medal, making Patrick among the first Americans so awarded by the French artistic community; some sources denote him as the first American from west of the Mississippi River to be so honored. He returned home to the United States, teaching at the St. Louis School of Art for three years. In 1903 he moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where he took a position at the Kansas City Art Institute.

He was a child prodigy who, aged eleven, became the youngest student to enter the Royal Academy Schools. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded at his family home in London, at 83 Gower Street (now number 7). Millais became the most famous exponent of the style, his painting Christ in the House of His Parents (1849-50) generating considerable controversy, and he produced a picture that could serve as the embodiment of the historical and naturalist focus of the group, Ophelia, in 1851–52.\nBy the mid-1850s, Millais was moving away from the Pre-Raphaelite style to develop a new form of realism in his art. His later works were enormously successful, making Millais one of the wealthiest artists of his day, but some former admirers including William Morris saw this as a sell-out (Millais notoriously allowed one of his paintings to be used for a sentimental soap advertisement). While these and early 20th-century critics, reading art through the lens of Modernism, viewed much of his later production as wanting, this perspective has changed in recent decades, as his later works have come to be seen in the context of wider changes and advanced tendencies in the broader late nineteenth-century art world, and can now be seen as predictive of the art world of the present.\nMillais's personal life has also played a significant role in his reputation. His wife Effie was formerly married to the critic John Ruskin, who had supported Millais's early work. The annulment of the marriage and her wedding to Millais have sometimes been linked to his change of style, but she became a powerful promoter of his work and they worked in concert to secure commissions and expand their social and intellectual circles.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["John Everett Millais", 4]]], "2_birth": [[["1829", 74]]], "3_death": [[["1896", 91]]], "4_nationality": [[["British", 0]]]}}

{"docid": "Wikipedia-20310", "doctext": "Jonas Lundh (born April 8, 1965 in Fagersta, Västmanland, Sweden), is a Swedish abstract expressionist artist, represented in a number of municipalities in Sweden and among collectors in the US, Great Britain, Denmark, Finland, Africa and France. Lundh creates his own world of art, where \"clarity is prohibited\" and rhythm is one of the main ingredients.Lundh has developed a technique in which he paints with paperboard instead of brushes. The characteristic features of his painting are the figurative elements in his abstract images, often with mystical surfaces of emptiness. The people in Lundh's paintings are anonymous; more like symbols than individuals, and it is not difficult to see how they connect to the history of abstract expressionism. Observers have said that Jonas Lundh in his painting \"reaches a cubist effect\".Lundh's art is dominated by mysticism. Some of his works have been compared to works by American painter Edward Hopper, as he has managed to concentrate the light and express something of the same loneliness in his paintings.As one of southern Sweden's most active exhibiting painters, Lundh has also worked with installation- and video art, always with musical undertones. His ways of combining the two professions are considered brilliant. He often works with projects that include both music and painting. Lundh Meets Lindgren is a project that started in August 2007, where Lundh and guitarist Tommy Lindgren \"visualize tones, sounds and rhythms in a conversation between two modes of expression\". Together with Örjan Bertilsson and Alf Nilsson, Lundh and Lindgren form the band State of Art, playing modern jazz with elements of Latin, soul and funk.In the 1980s, Jonas Lundh worked as a freelance musician, playing drums and percussion. He has also played the flute and the violin.Jonas Lundh has spoken out against racism, saying there should not be any racism in music.Lundh is currently a resident of Sölvesborg. He lives with his family in the rectory (from 1833), next to St Nicholas' Church (Sankt Nikolai kyrka) in central Sölvesborg.
