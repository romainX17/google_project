{"docid": "Wikipedia-00526", "doctext": "Agatharchus or Agatharch (Ancient Greek: Ἀγάθαρχος) was a self-taught painter from Samos, who lived in the 5th century BC. His father was named Eudemos (Εὔδημος).\nHe is said by Vitruvius to have invented scenic painting, and to have painted a scene (scenam fecit) for a tragedy which Aeschylus exhibited.  Hence some writers, such as Karl Woermann, have supposed that he introduced perspective and illusionism into painting.However, as this appears to contradict Aristotle's assertion that scenic painting was introduced by Sophocles, some scholars understand Vitruvius to mean merely that Agatharchus constructed a stage.  But the context shows clearly that perspective painting must be meant, for Vitruvius goes on to say that Democritus and Anaxagoras, carrying out the principles laid down in a treatise written by Agatharchus, wrote on the same subject, showing how, in drawing, the lines ought to be made to correspond, according to a natural proportion, to the figure which would be traced out on an imaginary intervening plane by a pencil of rays proceeding from the eye, as a fixed point of sight, to the several points of the object viewed.\nIt was probably not till towards the end of Aeschylus's career that scenic painting was introduced, and not till the time of Sophocles that it was generally made use of, which may account for what Aristotle says.Agatharchus was therefore the first painter known to have used graphical perspective on a large scale, although rare occurrences of perspective do appear in vase painting around the middle of the 6th century BC.  He is also said to have led the way for later painters, such as Apollodorus.Agatharchus was a contemporary of Alcibiades and Zeuxis, and was often singled out for the ease and rapidity with which he finished his works.  Plutarch and Andocides at greater length tell an anecdote of Alcibiades having inveigled Agatharchus to his house and kept him there for more than three months in strict durance, compelling him to paint it.  The speech of Andocides above referred to seems to have been delivered after the destruction of Melos (416 BC) and before the expedition to Sicily (415 BC); so that from the above data the age of Agatharchus may be accurately fixed.", "extracts": {"birth": [], "death": [], "nationality": [[["Greek", 34]]], "painter_name": [[["Agatharchus", 0]]]}}

Through her work, she explores notions of hybridity, assemblage, and metamorphosis, focusing particularly on the female figure: the self is experienced and presented as multiple, fluid, paradoxical. Paz's paintings are as much portraits as they are landscapes, combining references that range from erudite painting or the history of the painted image, to citations of advertising images or comics. Inhabiting fantastical and exotic landscapes, Paz's feminine subjects become fused and combined with organic life. Strange and unsettling visions of tree-women and monster-women also represent the fusion of the Subject with painting itself: she often depicts amphibian or plant-like figures “weeping” pigment, their limbs, hair, and various ornamental accoutrements mud-caked and dripping, as if extracted from a colourful, post-cognitive swamp.\nIn August 2017 Paz unveiled a public sculpture commission at Kunstmuseum Kloster Unser Lieben Frauen in Magdeburg, titled Insel der Puppen (Island of Dolls), in steel and enamel.

Alvise may have trained Jacopo de' Barbari.\nIt has sometimes been supposed that, besides the Luigi who was the latest of this pictorial family, there had also been another Luigi who was the earliest (i.e. Antonio's father), this supposition being founded on the fact that one picture is signed with the name, with the date 1414. There is good ground, however, for considering this date to be a forgery of a later time.The works of Vivarini show an advance on those of his predecessors, and some of them are productions of high attainment; one of the best was executed for the Scuola di San Girolamo in Venice, representing the saint caressing his lion, and some monks decamping in terror. The architecture and perspective in this work are superior.Many churches in Venice have examples. Other works by Vivarini are in Treviso, Milan and the National Gallery, London. He painted some remarkable portraits.The Adoration of Christ dated 1476, in the sacristy of the church of Montefiorentino, is one of his early productions. In 1480 he painted a Virgin and Saints for San Francesco, Treviso, now in the Venice Accademia. To about this date belong the SS. Matthew and John the Baptist, in the same collection; and the fresco of Christ Carrying His Cross in Santi Giovanni e Paolo. In 1488, Alvise Vivarini wrote a letter to the Signory of Venice, requesting permission to share with Bellini in the commission to decorate the Hall of Great Council in the Doge's Palace. To this he received a favorable reply, and thereupon executed two paintings, which were burned in the fire of 1577. The subjects, Vasari tells us, were Otho promising to mediate between Venice and Barbarossa and Barbarossa receiving his Son. The Council were so pleased with the pictures that, in 1492, Alvise was named Depentor in Gran Conseio, with a salary of five ducats a month. Notwithstanding this work for the State, he continued to paint altar-pieces for private patrons. The Apotheosis of St. Ambrose (1503) in the Cappella Milimesi of the Frari, Venice, was probably the last production of Alvise, as the inscription tells us that it was completed after his death by Marco Basaiti, one of his pupils.", "extracts": {"birth": [], "death": [], "nationality": [[["Venetian", 83], ["Italian", 54]]], "painter_name": [[["Alvise Vivarini", 1692]]]}}

Although she became well known for her large abstract landscapes in acrylic and her decorative, colorful lithographs from the middle and late 1970s; ultimately, it is through the figural work that one may truly understand this complex artist.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-02122", "doctext": "Andrew Brown Donaldson was a British artist mainly active in the second half of the nineteenth century. He was born in 1840, although some sources say 1838, and was the second son of a solicitor named William Leverton Donaldson and his wife, Margaret Tennent. As their name implies, the Donaldsons were of Scottish descent and they were perhaps best known in the nineteenth century for their prominence in the field of architecture; William Leverton Donaldson's father, James Donaldson (1756-1844), and elder brother, Thomas Leverton Donaldson (1795-1885), were both renowned architects. Margaret Tennent was the daughter of John Tennent of Glasgow and his wife, Margaret Brown, daughter of Andrew Brown, after whom Andrew Brown Donaldson was evidently named. Inexplicably, Andrew Brown Donaldson is commonly referred to in the art world as Andrew Benjamin Donaldson.\nAndrew Brown Donaldson studied at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and he also underwent a period of training in Rome. In 1872 he was married at St. Pancras in London to Agnes Emily Twining, the youngest daughter of the well-known tea merchant Richard Twining (III) of Messrs R. Twining & Co. - Twinings - in the Strand. They had six children. Andrew's oil and watercolour paintings, the style of which was heavily influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite movement, primarily depict either actual landscapes or imagined scenes from history and mythology. Although based in London, living first in Kensington and latterly in Hampstead, Andrew Brown Donaldson frequently toured through mainland Europe in search of new scenes and inspiration, often accompanied by his wife and children. The London Metropolitan Archives holds a set of diaries kept jointly by Andrew and Agnes from the start of their marriage until the time of their deaths and they offer a vivid snapshot of domestic life in an upper-middle-class family in Victorian and Edwardian London.The Donaldsons retired to the New Forest in Hampshire in later life, settling in the village of Lyndhurst where they lived in a house called Woodhay. Agnes Emily Donaldson died there in 1918, followed by Andrew Brown Donaldson in 1919. During his lifetime his works were exhibited by the Royal Academy and the Society of Painters (now the Royal Watercolour Society), as well as at numerous other provincial exhibitions. Today, examples of his work can be seen at various public galleries and institutions, most notably Tate Britain (see below), the Palace of Westminster and New College, Oxford, as well as at the Guildhall in Winchester and the Usher Gallery in Lincoln. The Tate's painting is a watercolour of the famous bridge - Puente de San Martín - in the ancient Spanish city of Toledo, painted by Donaldson in 1889 and gifted to the gallery in 1899 by his wife's aunt, the social reformer Louisa Twining.\n\n\n== References ==", "extracts": {"birth": [], "death": [[["1919", 2146]]], "nationality": [[["British", 29]]], "painter_name": [[["Andrew Brown Donaldson", 0]]]}}

Plutarch's remarks concerning this work are of interest to art historians who study history painting as a genre.\nAccording to Plutarch, Androcydes received a commission from the city of Thebes to paint the battle scene on site. During this period (382–379 BC), the Theban oligarchy had allied with Sparta. When the Spartans were defeated in 379, the work remained unfinished. It was confiscated and dedicated to commemorate a minor skirmish at Plataea, probably in 370, before the Battle of Leuctra. Originally, the work was to have honored Pelopidas and Epaminondas, but through the efforts of a certain Menecleides, the name of the Theban commander Charon was substituted, either directly in the painting or on a separate dedicatory plaque.\nThis repurposing indicates that battle scenes might be depicted so generically that the ostensible subject of the work could be changed simply by giving it a new title and name labels. Although no longer extant, it is the only painting of a cavalry battle known to predate that of Euphranor.Indicative of an interest also in genre painting, Athenaeus reports that Androcydes' gourmet passion for seafood prompted him to devote inordinate attention to painting the fish around a central figure of Scylla in one of his works.\n\n\n== References ==", "extracts": {"birth": [], "death": [], "nationality": [[["Greek", 101]]], "painter_name": [[["Androcydes", 29]]]}}

He is influenced by artists such as Rubens, Titian, Michelangelo and Velázquez.\nAlthough Durand is perhaps best known for his allegorical portraits, such as Princess Diana as Fortuna, he achieved international artistic acclaim for his official portraits of John Paul II (1983) and the 14th Dalai Lama (1982, 1983, 1989). Durand's portrait of the Irish novelist Elizabeth Bowen (1972) is one of the most popular portraits in London's National Portrait Gallery. In 1970 Durand painted a series of pictures inspired by the dancers of the Royal Ballet. It is nevertheless Durand's extraordinary mythological narratives that demonstrate his profound understanding of the myths and rituals of both Classical and Christian traditions. These are an ever-present undercurrent of his work.\n\nFrom May to October 2006, a major exhibition of paintings, Durand Wholly Pictures, was displayed in Sussex cathedrals and churches. This series of pictures, painted between 2000 and 2006, depicts Christian narratives set against the Sussex countryside. Durand recognizes that the need is greater today than ever before for artists to take up devotional subjects in painting. Durand paints his sacred subjects for the benefit of those who are not satisfied by postmodern fashions in this post secular era as much as for churchgoers.\n\nThe Coronation of the Virgin, Stopham Bridge, Pulborough, 2006.\nNovember 1, 2007, marked the 20th anniversary of the unveiling of Durand's Votive Offering, which was painted to launch and benefit the AIDS charity Crusaid in 1987.

The picture, and the Idea Fine Art limited edition prints of the picture, each signed and numbered by the artist, is to be benefit Demelza Hospice Care for Children.\nAs Durand has said: 'almost all the young people that inspire me to paint them have something in common. I am convinced that I have met them before in a painting. When I consider the teenage behavior of the deities and saints in mythology or the Bible, not to mention heroes and heroines, the kids in my pictures are appropriate symbols of such protagonists.' How suitable therefore, for Durand to have represented the bravery of Daniel confronting death amongst the lions as a tribute to Demelza's dedication and sensitivity to the uniqueness of the physical, social, intellectual, emotional, cultural and spiritual needs of every child and their family.\nIn 2011 after his return to Italy and particularly Torre del Greco and Sperlonga we witness a new period in André Durand's artistic trajectory fully manifest, first in the pictures he painted in Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Sperlonga where Durand held an open studio for almost two years as artist in residence and later in Fondi.\nAt the invitation of doctor Marina Sapelli Ragni, Soprintendente per i Beni Archeologici della Regione Lazio and the director and personnel of the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Sperlonga from 2010-2012 the artist began a body of work, including a series of tondi (round format paintings) on the subject of the Via Lucis. These pictures were finished in the Palazzo Caetani in 2013. The famous Grotto of Tiberius can be seen in the background of five of the six tondos.\nOne painting Brother Carlo saving the Head of Ulysses was painted for the exhibition Dialogues with the Antique - Dialoghi con l'Antico curated by the archaeologist and author Marina Sapelli Ragni at the Villa Adriana, Tivoli in 2011. Durand's vision of a monk who stoically rescues the severed head of Odysseus.\n2012 also saw the publication of several books of Durand's photographs.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-02733", "doctext": "Anthony Toto or \"Antony\", real name Antonio di Nunziato d'Antonio (1498–1554), was an Italian painter and architect, a Florentine pupil of Ridolfo Ghirlandajo.  He came to England about 1519, and was naturalized in 1543, and was one of a number of foreign artists of the Tudor Court, being appointed Serjeant Painter in 1543. The English evidently found his Italian name too complicated, and he is normally called \"Antony Toto\" (in effect \"Anthony Tony\") in the records; he was already called \"Toto di Nunziato\" in Italian records.\nHis father was Nunziata d'Antonio, a painter who died in Florence in 1525.  \"Toto\" had been signed on in Florence on 28 September 1519 as an assistant to Pietro Torrigiano, who was already in England, but in fact left there for good later that year.  Vasari relates that Toto had worked in the shop of Nunziata's friend Ridolfo Ghirlandaio where he had painted a number of pictures that were sent to England (just as his fellow shop assistant Bartolomeo Ghetti is said to have made paintings that were sent to King Francis I of France before he himself departed for the French court). He had a Florentine colleague Bartolommeo Penni, brother of the much more distinguished Gianfrancesco, Raphael's right-hand man, and Luca, a member of the School of Fontainebleau.  Both Toto and Penni probably came to Henry from Cardinal Wolsey, as they first appear in the accounts just after Wolsey's fall in October 1529. Henry VIII appointed him Serjeant Painter, and he died still in office under Edward VI.  He was the first Serjeant Painter who can be evidenced as an artist rather than an artisan.  None of his paintings are known to survive, but his New Year gifts to Henry, presumably his own work, are documented as including a Calumny of Apelles (1538/39) and a Story of King Alexander (1540/41), and then in 1552 a portrait of a duke \"steyned upon cloth of silver\" for Edward VI.  In March 1538 Toto's servant was paid for bringing to the king at Hampton Court Palace a \"depicted table of Colonia\".   Toto and Penni are presumed to have spent most of their time after 1538 working on Nonsuch Palace, including elaborate stucco work for Henry's most advanced building, now vanished.\nToto was married, though little seems to be known about his wife,  and had at least one daughter, Winifred, who married Sir Charles Calthorpe, judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland). She died in 1605. Toto's services were evidently valued by the Crown, as he died a rich man, owning among other properties the manor of Ravensbury.\nNone of his father's works survive, and little is known of his work, though he is mentioned in Vasari, who would not have known him personally.  A document of 1517 names Nunziata and his son Toto as witnesses to the will of a legnaiuolo named Giuseppe di Lorenzo in the parish of San Pancrazio in September 1517. Surprisingly, here Nunziata is identified not as a painter but as a bombardier (‘Nunziato Antonii Dominici bombardiere’). Apparently as an old man he must have fallen upon hard times.  It was common for out-of-work craftsmen to moonlight as bombardiers (well-known examples include Raffaello da Montelupo and Zanobi Lastricati), though it was generally the province of masters in the more physically demanding arts, such as cannon-founders, sculptors, and scalpellini.   Nunziata is a rare, if not unique example of a Renaissance painter working as a bombardier.\nOn 28 September 1519 Nunziata personally recorded his consent as his son Antonio, called Toto del Nunziata, contracted to work abroad with Pietro Torrigiani for four and a half years.  At the time Toto signed on with Torrigiani he was several months past his twenty-first birthday; technically, therefore, his father's permission was not required for the contract. Nunziata may have wished to give his formal assent in order to ensure that there would be no qualms about the legitimacy of Toto's contract.  On the other hand, his recollection of his son Toto's exact age may merely have been a bit shaky.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1498", 67]]], "death": [[["1554", 72]]], "nationality": [[["Italian", 86]]], "painter_name": [[["Anthony Toto", 0]]]}}

Influenced by symbolism and art nouveau his art was known for its clear use of line, and its depiction of monstrous and sexual imagery. In an occult capacity, he developed idiosyncratic magical techniques including automatic writing, automatic drawing and sigilization based on his theories of the relationship between the conscious and unconscious self.\nBorn into a working-class family in Snow Hill in London, Spare grew up in Smithfield and then Kennington, taking an early interest in art. Gaining a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in South Kensington, he trained as a draughtsman, while also taking a personal interest in Theosophy and Occultism, becoming briefly involved with Aleister Crowley and his A∴A∴. Developing his own personal occult philosophy, he wrote a series of occult grimoires, namely Earth Inferno (1905), The Book of Pleasure (1913) and The Focus of Life (1921). Alongside a string of personal exhibitions, he also achieved much press attention for being the youngest entrant at the 1904 Royal Academy summer exhibition.\nAfter publishing two short-lived art magazines, Form and The Golden Hind, during the First World War he was conscripted into the armed forces and worked as an official war artist. Moving to various working class areas of South London over the following decades, Spare lived in poverty, but continued exhibiting his work to varying degrees of success. With the arrival of surrealism onto the London art scene during the 1930s, critics and the press once more took an interest in his work, seeing it as an early precursor to surrealist imagery. Losing his home during the Blitz, he fell into relative obscurity following the Second World War, although he continued exhibiting till his death in 1956.\nSpare's spiritualist legacy was largely maintained by his friend, the Thelemite author Kenneth Grant in the latter part of the 20th century, and his beliefs regarding sigils provided a key influence on the chaos magic movement and Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth. Spare's art once more began to receive attention in the 1970s, due to a renewed interest in art nouveau in Britain, with several retrospective exhibitions being held in London.

Karp envisioned feminism as a movement that can work across disciplinary boundaries and be informed by various traditions of inquiry. Her work was informed by her lifelong study of psychoanalysis.

Goller has participated in art restoration courses at the Stuttgart Art Academy. He has restored church altarpieces.\nIn 1974 a work by Goller was sold to the Cleveland Museum of Art for $1 million. It was purchased by the museum as a painting of St Catherine by Matthias Grünewald. The painting was on a panel that contained a crack, woodworm holes and evidence of repairs, all of which it appears had been added to give the painting an antique appearance. After an art historian questioned the painting's authenticity, the museum engaged conservator Hubert von Sonnenburg to examine it. His analysis of pigments from the painting showed the presence of processed chalk and the absence of silver traces in the lead paint, both indicating that the materials used were modern. Because the painting had passed through the hands of several intermediaries before being sold to the museum, Goller was not prosecuted. He claimed that he had sold the painting under his own name and that the attribution had been the work of one of the intermediate owners.Michael Hofbauer, a German art historian who specialises in the works of Cranach the Elder, has alleged that Goller has produced up to 55 fake Cranachs. Hofbauer says that a portrait of the emperor Charles V, described and attributed by Christie's Amsterdam saleroom as \"Circle of Lucas Cranach II (Wittenberg 1515-1586 Weimar) Portrait of Charles V oil on panel, transferred onto canvas laid down on panel 54.9 x 49.5 cm.\", was in fact painted by Goller; the painting was withdrawn from the 25 November 2014 sale. Accompanying the painting was a copy of a certificate by Alfred Stange, a German art historian who had apparently examined the painting in the 1950s in Munich.Hofbauer has stated that he attributes to Goller more than 60 paintings presently attributed to various artists, including Cranach, adding that the paintings have certain common features: they are painted on soft gauze or similar, on a base of gesso, which is then affixed to a wooden panel; the palette is limited to a few dull colours; and an analysis of the chemical composition of the pigments in these paintings, such as white lead, shows that the pigments used in the paintings are typical of those that would have been used in the 16th century. However, the hands of the figures are not characteristic of Cranach, and the craquelure evident in the paintings is not the result of aging but has been artificially produced. In addition, Hofbauer says he has in his possession correspondence from Dieter Koepplin of Basel, an expert in the paintings of the Cranachs, stating that Goller had produced forgeries though he did not know the specific paintings.\nThe District Court of Passau and the Baden-Württemberg State Office of Criminal Investigation have begun an investigation into Goller's activities.\n\n\n== References ==", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1943", 29]]], "death": [[["2017", 48]]], "nationality": [[["German", 60]]], "painter_name": [[["Christian Goller", 0]]]}}

He spent most of his life in Italy, and is one of the earliest important artists, apart from his contemporaries in Dutch Golden Age painting, to concentrate on landscape painting.  His landscapes are usually turned into the more prestigious genre of history paintings by the addition of a few small figures, typically representing a scene from the Bible or classical mythology.\nBy the end of the 1630s he was established as the leading landscapist in Italy, and enjoyed large fees for his work. His landscapes gradually became larger, but with fewer figures, more carefully painted, and produced at a lower rate. He was not generally an innovator in landscape painting, except in introducing the Sun into many paintings, which had been rare before.  He is now thought of as a French painter, but was born in the independent Duchy of Lorraine, and almost all his painting was done in Italy; before the late 19th century he was regarded as a painter of the \"Roman School\". His patrons were also mostly Italian, but after his death he became very popular with English collectors, and the UK retains a high proportion of his works.\n\nHe was a prolific creator of drawings in pen and very often monochrome watercolour \"wash\", usually brown but sometimes grey. Chalk is sometimes used for under-drawing, and white highlighting in various media may be employed, much less often other colours such as pink.  These fall into three fairly distinct groups. Firstly there are large numbers of sketches, mostly of landscapes, and apparently very often done at the scene; these have been greatly admired, and influenced other artists. Then there are studies for paintings, of various degrees of finish, many clearly done before or during the process of painting, but others perhaps after that was complete. This was certainly the case for the last group, the 195 drawings recording finished paintings collected in his Liber Veritatis (now in the British Museum). He produced over 40 etchings, often simplified versions of paintings, mainly before 1642.  These served various purposes for him, but are now regarded as much less important than his drawings. He painted frescoes in his early career, which played an important part in making his reputation, but are now nearly all lost.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1600", 136]]], "death": [[["1682", 155]]], "nationality": [[["French", 16]]], "painter_name": [[["Claude Lorrain", 0]]]}}

A multi-talent, he was also an art scholar and innovator in the field of cinematography as well as an amateur photographer. Kakabadze's works are notable for combining innovative interpretation of European \"Leftist\" art with Georgian national traditions, on which he was an expert.   \n\nKakabadze was born into a poor peasant family in the village of Kukhi near the town of Khoni. Sponsored by local philanthropists, he studied natural sciences at St. Petersburg University from which he graduated in 1916. At the same time, he attended painting classes at the studio of Dmitroyev-Kavkazsky and did a research in old Georgian arts. After a brief period of working as a painter and educator in Tbilisi, he went to Paris where he lived from 1919 to 1927. He partook in the Société des Artistes Indépendants exhibitions and joint exhibitions with the Georgian artists Lado Gudiashvili and Shalva Kikodze. The cycle of landscapes reproducing the nature of Kakabadze's native province of Imereti is some of the most interesting of his early works. During his stay in Paris, Kakabadze was attracted by \"subjectless painting,\" and worked on problems of pictorial technique, occasionally using metal, mirror glass, stained glass and other such materials in place of paints. He soon went over to an even more \"Leftist\" position, and paid generous tribute to cubism. He lectured on various aspects of visual arts in Paris and, developing his interest in kinetic form, in 1923 he constructed a film camera that produced the illusion of relief and thus became one of the pioneers of three-dimensional cinema. By the mid-1920s he had rejected his cubist-influenced style in favor of more abstract sculpture and painting.\nHaving return to Georgia in 1927, Kakabadze continued his Imereti themes in new monumental decorative landscapes, including industrial landscapes. Around the same time, he collaborated with the leading Georgian theatre director Kote Marjanishvili to produce several set designs for Marjanishvili's theatre in Kutaisi. In 1931, he also produced a documental film \"The Old Monuments of Georgia\".Kakabadze became a professor at the Tbilisi State Academy of Arts in 1928, but came under pressure from Soviet authorities for \"failure\" to abandon Formalism and adapt to the dogmas of Social realism. Eventually, he was dismissed from the Academy in 1948.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1889", 56]]], "death": [[["1952", 71]]], "nationality": [[["Georgian", 18]]], "painter_name": []}}

He was a contemporary with Fra Angelico and Fra Filippo Lippi, since those two artists and himself are known to have valued the frescoes of Buonfigli at Perugia. Between 1439 and 1441 he painted a masterpiece of the Adoration of the Magi.\nAnother masterpiece is considered to be the Santa Lucia de' Magnoli Altarpiece (c. 1445–1447), originally in Santa Lucia dei Magnoli, Florence and now in the Uffizi.  Painted in tempera on panel, the altarpiece displays such an unusual palette for this period that Vasari wrote that it had been painted in oil. Domenico is also known for a round panel of the Adoration of the Magi (1439–1441) which was probably commissioned for the palace of the wealthy Medici family and now in Berlin.

However, Castagno died c. 1457, four years before Domenico.\nHe worked at the decorations of the Portinari chapel in the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence from 1439–1445, and had as his assistants Piero della Francesca and Bicci di Lorenzo.

His studies there covered twenty-two subjects, including bookbinding, papermaking, drawing, painting, portraiture, as well as the more conventional subjects of history, political economics, languages, and math. His undergraduate and graduate training focused on traditional painting techniques but also explored aspects of sculpture, jewellery design, art restoration, and architecture.

After completing his Masters, he was fortunate to be able to make a living as an artist in his homeland. Most of his early works were commercial art projects but he also contributed to a number of exhibitions, and was invited to participate in the design of Man and His World, the Czech pavilion at the 1967 World Expo in Montreal.\nLike many other artists of his generation, Kadlec has been criticized by some in the arts community for marketing signed reproductions of his work; his critics asserting that these reproductions are little more than expensive posters with limited intrinsic value compared to original works of art.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-08566", "doctext": "Early Netherlandish painting, traditionally known as the Flemish Primitives, refers to the work of artists active in the Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands during the 15th- and 16th-century Northern Renaissance period. It flourished especially in the cities of Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen, Leuven, Tournai and Brussels, all in present-day Belgium. The period begins approximately with Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck in the 1420s and lasts at least until the death of Gerard David in 1523, although many scholars extend it to the start of the Dutch Revolt in 1566 or 1568 (Max J. Friedländer's acclaimed surveys run through Pieter Bruegel the Elder). Early Netherlandish painting coincides with the Early and High Italian Renaissance but the early period (until about 1500) is seen as an independent artistic evolution, separate from the Renaissance humanism that characterised developments in Italy, although beginning in the 1490s as increasing numbers of Netherlandish and other Northern painters traveled to Italy, Renaissance ideals and painting styles were incorporated into northern painting. As a result, Early Netherlandish painters are often categorised as belonging to both the Northern Renaissance and the Late or International Gothic.\nThe major Netherlandish painters include Campin, van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Dieric Bouts, Petrus Christus, Hans Memling, Hugo van der Goes and Hieronymus Bosch. These artists made significant advances in natural representation and illusionism, and their work typically features complex iconography.  Their subjects are usually religious scenes or small portraits, with narrative painting or mythological subjects being relatively rare. Landscape is often richly described but relegated as a background detail before the early 16th century. The painted works are generally oil on panel, either as single works or more complex portable or fixed altarpieces in the form of diptychs, triptychs or polyptychs. The period is also noted for its sculpture, tapestries, illuminated manuscripts, stained glass and carved retables.\nThe first generations of artists were active during the height of Burgundian influence in Europe, when the Low Countries became the political and economic centre of Northern Europe, noted for its crafts and luxury goods. Assisted by the workshop system, panels and a variety of crafts were sold to foreign princes or merchants through private engagement or market stalls. A majority of the works were destroyed during waves of iconoclasm in the 16th and 17th centuries; today only a few thousand examples survive.\nEarly northern art in general was not well regarded from the early 17th to the mid-19th century, and the painters and their works were not well documented until the mid-19th century. Art historians spent almost another century determining attributions, studying iconography, and establishing bare outlines of even the major artists' lives; attribution of some of the most significant works is still debated. Scholarship of Early Netherlandish painting was one of the main activities of 19th- and 20th-century art history, and a major focus of two of the most important art historians of the 20th century: Max J. Friedländer (From Van Eyck to Breugel and Early Netherlandish Painting) and Erwin Panofsky (Early Netherlandish Painting).", "extracts": {"birth": [], "death": [], "nationality": [[["Early Netherlandish", 0], ["Flemish", 57], ["Dutch", 539]]], "painter_name": [[["Early Netherlandish painting", 0]]]}}

He was born in Almeria, Spain in 1914. With his family, he immigrated in 1921 to the United States. They resided in Brooklyn, New York.\nA fundamentally self-taught artist, Castellón began sketching at an early age. He took advantage of his family's relocation and visited the museums of New York. Consequently, his influences ranged from Old Masters to the modern artists of his day, including Giorgio de Chirico, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, and Georges Rouault.\nCastellón attended Erasmus High School, where his teachers recognized his draughtsmanship. After graduation, he completed a mural for the school based on the subject of arts and sciences. The mural was informed by Castellón's interest in the modern European movements, and it attracted critical attention when exhibited at Raymond & Raymond Galleries in New York before it was installed permanently in the school.\nAbout this time, Castellón was introduced to Diego Rivera, who had an international reputation and was painting murals for Rockefeller Center. The older artist took an interest in the young man's work and brought Castellón's drawings to the attention of the director of the Weyhe Gallery in New York, who subsequently gave the eighteen-year-old Castellón his first solo exhibition.\nIn 1934, with Rivera’s help, Castellón was awarded a four-year fellowship, sponsored by the Spanish Government, to travel throughout Europe to study painting and printmaking. During this same period, Castellón began to exhibit his work in museums in France and Spain.\nIn 1935, Castellón participated in the Paris Exhibition of Spanish Artists that included Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, and Joan Miró.\nIn 1937, Castellón returned to New York and began experimenting with the medium of lithography, using this medium to create illustrations for Edgar Allan Poe's allegorical tale, \"The Masque of Red Death\". Over the years, Castellón's work as an illustrator would eventually include Bulfinch's Mythology, The Story of Marco Polo, and The Little Prince.\nIn 1940, Castellón received the first of two Guggenheim fellowships. His work continued to attract attention as he was included in exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago.\nCastellón became an American citizen in 1943. During WWII, he was with the OSS and assigned to the Burma theater. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, his work was informed by his travels abroad: to China with the U.S. Army; to Italy on his second Guggenheim fellowship; and to Paris and Madrid, where he moved his family for a brief period during which he undertook commissions from American periodicals, including The Epic of Man series for LIFE magazine.\nIn 1949, he was commissioned by the Print Club of Albany for its annual print.\nAlthough his formal education ended with high school, Castellón taught at Teachers College, Columbia University, Pratt Institute, and Queens College. He was elected to membership in the National Academy of Design in New York, was awarded a First Prize from the Library of Congress, and he was a member of the Society of American Graphic Artists.\nCastellón died in 1971. A retrospective of his prints was held at the Allied Artists of America in 1978. In 1982, a retrospective exhibition of his work was held at Anderson & Anderson Master Prints (Loveland, Colorado). In 2004, his prints and paintings were exhibited at Emil Nelson Gallery (Denver, Colorado). In early 2010, Castellón's work was exhibited at the Kalamazoo Institute, along with the graphic work of Francisco Goya.\nAlthough Castellón worked in virtually every media, he remains best known for his early graphic work, particularly his lithographs and etchings, media in which he became a master. His prints and drawings of the early 1930s are the first examples of Surrealism created by an American; a considerable feat because Castellón produced these highly original works not only before his travels abroad, but before the seminal exhibition \"Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism\" at New York's Museum of Modern Art.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1914", 21]]], "death": [[["1971", 54]]], "nationality": [[["Spanish", 86], ["American", 94]]], "painter_name": [[["Federico Castellón", 0]]]}}

In 2014, her drawings were shown in an exhibition entitled Deconstruct at De Queeste Kunstkamers, Belgium. She has exhibited in Britain, Europe, Australia and Japan.\n\n“They are desperate paintings, fetching isolated and sombre emotion from the deep recesses – they are 'primeval, before language, dredged from the back of your mind'. They are Beckett-like landscapes and express something like anxiety, unease, restlessness, all tinged with melancholy or plain sadness.”\nDr Edward Winters, West Dean College, 2005, from the introduction in the catalogue for Frances Aviva Blane's show, Prime Time: Painting, Frances Aviva Blane – paintings & drawings 2006 at Galerie Seitz & Partner, Berlin, January – February 2006\n“Blane’s drawings are not for the faint-hearted.

He is considered to be the most important landscape painter to have emerged from his adopted city of Venice during the mid-eighteenth century, and his Arcadian views became popular throughout Europe and especially in England where he resided for two extended periods.  His patronage extended to the nobility, and he often collaborated with other artists such as Antonio Visentini and Bernardo Bellotto. In 1768, Zuccarelli became a founding member of the Royal Academy of Arts, and upon his final return to Italy, he was elected president of the Venetian Academy. In addition to his rural landscapes which frequently incorporated religious and classical themes, Zuccarelli created devotional pieces and on occasion did portraiture. Beside paintings, his varied output included etchings, drawings, and designs for tapestries as well as a set of Old Testament playing cards.\nDespite the fame he experienced in his lifetime, Zuccarelli's reputation declined in the early 19th century with naturalism becoming increasingly favoured in landscapes. Turner criticized him in mild terms while confessing that his figures could be beautiful, paving the way for more severe Victorian assessments. In 1959, the art historian Michael Levey offered suggestions for why Zuccarelli held such wide contemporary appeal among the English, concluding that his best work is highly decorative.

In early adulthood, he performed as an operatic tenor, but was eventually forced to abandon his singing career after suffering difficulties with his voice. He had changed his name (from his original name, Hermolaus Ionides) to an Italian one because he had been advised that it would assist him with his opera career. According to his close friend, the composer Alan Hovhaness, \"...he wanted to be an opera singer when he was young. Some local conductor said he should have an Italian name, so he had this peculiar name that didn't have anything to do with him, but is a translation.\"In Boston, while working at the counter of a Boston-area Hayes-Bickford's (a cafeteria-style restaurant), he befriended Alan Hovhaness and the painter Hyman Bloom, who often ate dinner there. Beginning around the early 1940s, the three often met to listen to Indian classical music and discuss various mystical subjects. Also a member of this circle was Dr. Elizabeth A. Gregory, a Boston pediatrician to whom di Giovanno gave a number of his paintings just before his final return to Greece. Gregory donated these paintings to Bates College in Lewiston, Maine.\nIt was not until he was in his forties that di Giovanno began painting. Although he first began modestly, drawing on paper in black and white, eventually Hyman Bloom encouraged him to work in color, supplying him with a box of colored pastels. Di Giovanno believed his artworks to be directly inspired by otherworldly supernatural forces.\nHovhaness often referred to di Giovanno as his \"spiritual guide\" and \"psychic teacher,\" and stated that he was often referred to as \"the Socrates of Boston.\" Hovhaness believed that di Giovanno provided the \"spiritual forces\" required to allow him to compose his Easter Cantata (1953), and his Symphony No. 6, \"Celestial Gate\" (1959) is named after an artwork by di Giovanno. Hovhaness's Symphony No. 9, \"St. Vartan\" (1950), while not originally dedicated to di Giovanno, was later dedicated to him (possibly at the time of the symphony's recording, after di Giovanno's death).\nDi Giovanno exerted an influence on the American painter David Barbero (1938–1999), who met di Giovanno in 1957 [6], and was also a mentor to the artist Paul Shapiro and the musician Gil Magno.Di Giovanno's great-nephew, the Athens, Georgia singer-songwriter Peter Alvanos, counts him as one of his primary inspirations, and named his band, Fabulous Bird, after one of di Giovanno's paintings. The Fort Smith, Arkansas punk rock band, Giovanno, uses his surname as his artwork has inspired their early lyrics.\n\n\n== References ==", "extracts": {"birth": [], "death": [[["1968", 92]]], "nationality": [[["Greek", 44], ["American", 2355]]], "painter_name": [[["Hermon di Giovanno", 0]]]}}

He was barely mentioned in Arnold Houbraken's major source book on 17th-century Dutch painting (Grand Theatre of Dutch Painters and Women Artists) and was thus omitted from subsequent surveys of Dutch art for nearly two centuries. In the 19th century, Vermeer was rediscovered by Gustav Friedrich Waagen and Théophile Thoré-Bürger, who published an essay attributing 66 pictures to him, although only 34 paintings are universally attributed to him today. Since that time, Vermeer's reputation has grown, and he is now acknowledged as one of the greatest painters of the Dutch Golden Age.\nSimilar to other major Dutch Golden Age artists such as Frans Hals and Rembrandt, Vermeer never went abroad.

Through his long political service during the monarchy and the important roles he played in the resistance and opposition to its overthrow, Nāwahī is regarded as an influential Hawaiian patriot.\nBorn on the island of Hawaii, Nāwahī received his formal education in the Protestant missionary schools of the islands. He began his career as a teacher at the Hilo Boarding School and later became a self-taught lawyer. He was also an accomplished artist, and was one of the few indigenous Hawaiian painters to work in Western styles during the 19th century. Entering the realm of politics in 1872 as a member of the House of Representatives, he represented his home districts of Puna and later Hilo in the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii for two decades. Serving in the final legislative assembly 1892–1893, he became a political leader for the Liberal faction in the government. He established himself as a leader in the opposition to the unpopular Bayonet Constitution of 1887 and as a defender of the idea of Hawaiian nationhood and self-rule. Alongside William Pūnohu White, he was a principal author of the proposed 1893 Constitution with Queen Liliʻuokalani. They were decorated Knight Commanders of the Royal Order of Kalākaua for their service and contribution to the monarchy. Three days after an attempted promulgation of the constitution, the queen was deposed in a coup during the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17, 1893.\nDuring the Provisional Government of Hawaii and the Republic of Hawaii that followed it, he remained loyal to the fallen monarchy. He was elected as president of the Hui Aloha ʻĀina (Hawaiian Patriotic League), a patriotic organization established after the overthrow to oppose annexation. He and his wife Emma Nāwahī (a political leader in her own right) established the anti-annexation newspaper Ke Aloha Aina.\nIn December 1894, Nāwahī was arrested and imprisoned by the Republic on charges of treason. He was acquitted and released, but died, on September 14, 1896, from tuberculosis contracted during his imprisonment. His funeral services in Honolulu and Hilo were attended by supporters and friends; even his former enemies and the government of the Republic acknowledged his important contributions as a Hawaiian patriot.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1842", 38]]], "death": [[["1896", 59]]], "nationality": [], "painter_name": []}}

Lumerman studied there with European trained teachers including Aquiles Badi known for his Constructivist and metaphysical tendencies and es:Emilio Centurion known for his command of volumes and form, as well as with es:Carlos Ripamonte a painter of an earlier generation known for his work in an Impressionist vein.\nIn 1936, Lumerman won first prize in the VI Feminine Salon of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires.  In a 1993 essay, art historian Cesar Magrini evokes the period and describes Lumerman as \"...a pioneer and an explorer of new paths.  Those were years when one could count on the fingers of one hand those women who were permitted to paint, model or sculpt without its being considered a perversion.\"\nBy the early 1940s, Juana Lumerman was showing her painting in Buenos Aires with a mixed group of her accomplished peers.  In 1941, Los Angeles County Museum of Art invited several Argentine artists to represent their country in a US exhibition; the group included Lino Enea Spilimbergo, Raquel Forner, Ramón Gomez Cornet, Antonio Berni, Emilio Pettoruti and Juana Lumerman.\nIn 1945, Juana Lumerman spent a year exhibiting, traveling and working in Brazil.  Throughout Lumerman's career, dynamic images of carnival, soccer and tango were to serve as counterpoints to more statically structured, more metaphysical, cityscape and still life themes in her painting.\nIn 1948, Juana Lumerman traveled to Washington, DC for another invitational show and then toured the US. In 1950, the artist traveled to northern Argentina where much of Buenos Aires' intelligentsia had decamped in an attempt to avoid the constraints of Juan Perón's visual aesthetic.\nDespite her travels to Brazil and to Argentina's colorful northern provinces, Lumerman's palette tended to be cool and tonally somber. The artist typically painted easel-size works in oil on board or canvas using a loosely figurative style notable for its fluidity of line and skillful paint handling.\nIn a 1952 article the British fine art magazine \"The Studio\" names Juana Lumerman, Raquel Forner and  es:Mane Bernardo as the three key women in Argentina's visual arts scene.\nPossibly by choice (?), Juana Lumerman exhibited rarely in subsequent years, with notable exceptions being a solo show at the respected Van Riel Gallery in 1967 and a prestigious 1968 Salon Estimulo show with Argentine masters and contemporary artists including Carlos Alonso, Juan Carlos Castagnino, Riganelli, Policastro, Carlos Ripamonte Berni and Raúl Soldi.

One of his most memorable paintings was a 12-foot high image of Orson Welles at the Studio Theatre in Vancouver, British Columbia.In the 1950s, Smith travelled the western USA, eventually working as a journeyman sign painter in Laguna Beach, California. In 1952, he married Arlene Legault and began painting formally. They raised their sons (Mike and Blake) and a daughter (Jamie).\nSmith led workshops and mentored artists such as Cameron Bird and Karen Hershey. His circle of friends included painters Carl Rungius, Nicholas de Grandmaison and sculptor Nicholas Scriver.Smith was adamant that painting was about technique and feeling as much as subject; that brushwork was as important as composition. The bulk of his artwork comprised oil paintings and pencil sketches.\nSmith lived in and near Cranbrook, B.C. through the 1970s and 80s. He later moved to Vancouver and then to Qualicum Beach where he lived and painted until his death in July, 2000.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1924", 78]]], "death": [[["2000", 1548]]], "nationality": [[["Canadian", 33]]], "painter_name": []}}
