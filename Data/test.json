On leaving school A. R. Quinton studied painting at the Heatherley School of Fine Art following which he worked as a steel engraver, but deciding on a career in art he began to work in oils in about 1874 and after in watercolour, working from a studio in Fleet Street in London and after at Lincoln's Inn, exhibiting several of his watercolour paintings at the latter with the Ipswich Fine Art Club in 1882 and 1883. From 1877 Quinton exhibited watercolours at the Royal Society of British Artists.He married Elizabeth Annie Crompton (1858-1946) at Bolton in Lancashire in May 1885 and with her had two sons: Leonard Quinton (1886-1981) and Edgar Allan Quinton (1891-1912).\n\nIn 1895 he and a friend cycled from Land's End to John O'Groats and Quinton's artworks from the trip were after serialised in the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News. His artwork became more in demand and he was able to buy a house with a studio in Finchley in London. His work routine would be to travel around England and Wales for three months of the year, mostly during the summer months and often by bicycle, during which he would draw sketches and take photographs of locations which he would work up into paintings in his studio during the winter months. Many of his artworks were published as postcards by Raphael Tuck and J Salmon Ltd which remain popular with today's collectors. His paintings have also been published in many calendars. Well over 2,000 of his paintings were published between 1904 and the time of his death. He also illustrated a number of books including The Historic Thames by Hilaire Belloc.\n\nHe exhibited at the Birmingham Royal Society of British Artists; Dudley Gallery; Dowdeswell Gallery; Grosvenor Gallery; Liverpool Walker Art Gallery; Manchester City Art Gallery; the Royal Society of British Artists; Royal Hibernian Academy; Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colour and the Royal Institute of Oil Painters. He exhibited at the Royal Academy but he was later banned from exhibiting there  as the authorities were not in favour of his 'commercialisation' of art.

They painted at a time when stained glass was losing popularity in favour of their method, the usage of vitreous enamels on glass as a blank canvas and then fired.

When religious conflicts broke out in France, he fled to London around 1621, where he quickly found employment in a glazier's studio through connections in the Dutch expatriate community. Abraham joined him around 1623. Abraham van Linge's work can be seen most prominently in the chapels of University College, Oxford and Lincoln College, Oxford, and at Christ Church, Oxford in England, where the lead lining is particularly noticeable.

In Breslau, he was appointed a Chief cantor of the White Stork Synagogue – one of the two main synagogues of the city.She married the painter and art historian Erich Klossowski; the couple moved to Paris, where their sons were born — Pierre in 1905 and Balthasar in 1908. Elisabeth Spiro Klossowski pursued her own artistic career under the name Baladine Klossowska; she preferred life in France and lived there through much of her later life.\nThe Klossowskis were forced to leave France in 1914, at the start of World War I, due to their German passports. The couple separated permanently in 1917; Klossowska took her sons to Switzerland. They moved to Berlin in 1921 due to financial pressures.

Her sons developed close relationships with Rilke, and Balthasar published his first book of watercolors about a lost cat, Mitsou, with text by Rilke.

Her early portraits of well-known male artists, such as Chuck Close and Leon Golub, reversed conventional artist/sitter gender and power dynamics; her later projects upend the traditionally \"heroic\" nature of portraiture by featuring underrepresented groups and everyday people. Zlamany has exhibited internationally at institutions including the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei, National Museum, Gdańsk, and New-York Historical Society.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-05680", "doctext": "Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic ruins. His primary interest was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \"the tragedy of landscape\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his paintings in Berlin. By the 1920s his paintings had been discovered by the Expressionists, and in the 1930s and early 1940s Surrealists and Existentialists frequently drew ideas from his work. The rise of Nazism in the early 1930s again saw a resurgence in Friedrich's popularity, but this was followed by a sharp decline as his paintings were, by association with the Nazi movement, interpreted as having a nationalistic aspect. It was not until the late 1970s that Friedrich regained his reputation as an icon of the German Romantic movement and a painter of international importance.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Caspar David Friedrich", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1774", 36]]], "3_death": [[["1840", 49]]], "4_nationality": [[["German", 74]]]}}

W. Ayer & Son advertising agency, starting as a layout designer in 1924 and rising to vice president in charge of art in 1936. He was among the first in his field to commission modern artists. For example, for one of his early advertising campaigns (\"Great Ideas of Western Man\" for the Container Corporation of America), he incorporated works by such artists as Pablo Picasso, Georgia O'Keeffe and Salvador Dalí. He once sent O'Keeffe to Hawaii for a campaign for canned pineapple juice. When \"she came back with all kinds of beautiful paintings but nothing to do with pineapple\", she explained that nobody had shown her any pineapple plants, so he sent her one, which she then painted.\n\nWhen the administrator of the National Recovery Act (NRA) was dissatisfied with designs presented by Ayer, Coiner himself designed the Blue Eagle symbol that is closely associated with the NRA. He also conceived the Red Feather emblem of the Community Chest. During World War II, he designed war and civil defense posters; an offset lithograph of one with the slogan \"Give It Your Best!\" (1942) for the Office of Emergency Management is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art.

This was dominated by the Flemish south, but painters from the north were also important.  Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting, of which Antwerp became the centre, covers the period up to about 1580 or later, by the end of which the north and south Netherlands had become politically separated.

However this distinction, well understood in modern Belgium, has always been disregarded by most foreign observers and writers.  Flanders delivered the leading painters in Northern Europe and attracted many promising young painters from other countries.

In 1894, he took up the position of art teacher at the Staatsmeisjesskool, which later became the Pretoria High School for Girls and at the same time rented a studio in Church Street East. He eked out a living by drawing newspaper cartoons and helping Anton van Wouw with commissions. A frequent visitor to the studio during this period was one of his art students, Pierneef.In 1896, Oerder went on a painting holiday to Zululand, and arranged an exhibition of his work in Cape Town.\nWith the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War in 1899, he was appointed official war artist by President Paul Kruger. His sketches and paintings from this bitter period are held at the War Museum in Bloemfontein, the Africana Museum in Johannesburg and the art collection of the University of Pretoria.In 1903, after the war, and no doubt still remembering his Zululand trip, Oerder travelled and painted along the East African coast, contracting malaria during the trip. He was elected a member of the South African Society of Artists in 1905, and with the tide finally turning in his favour,\nreceived several commissions to paint landscapes and portraits, such as that of General Louis Botha.\nHe found conditions difficult in postwar South Africa and in 1908 returned to the Netherlands via Italy. At first he settled in Brabant, but later moved to Amsterdam where he married a fellow painter, Gerda Pitlo, in 1910. Her interest in flower painting influenced him and he started on still life compositions, especially flower studies. His painting Magnolias was sold to the New York Graphic Society, becoming one of the most popular images ever and reproductions of this still life achieved record sales for the Society, Oerder receiving no royalties whatever. Oerder hadn't forgotten his ties to South Africa, and occasionally carried out commissions such as designing covers for the weekly magazine, Die Brandwag, and arranging an exhibition in Johannesburg.\nHe eventually returned to Pretoria with his wife in 1938. His work by now was widely acclaimed, and in a grand gesture the tower-room of the Pretoria City Hall was made available to him for use as a studio. Here he painted several important portraits, including that of Jan Smuts. He now had the time and inclination to travel and paint in the Cape Province, Natal and the Northern Transvaal.\nComplications following on a bout of pneumonia left him debilitated, and he died in Pretoria in 1944. Throughout his career he had divided his output fairly evenly between landscape, portrait and still-life, with the Dutch influence always apparent.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Frans Oerder", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1867", 28]]], "3_death": [[["1944", 53]]], "4_nationality": [[["Dutch", 74], ["South African", 85]]]}}

He later ran an art school in Marylebone where he taught drawing, painting, and commercial subjects.\nOn 31 May 1827 Frederick I'Ons married Ann Frazer, whose ill-health led in 1834 to the young couple's emigrating to the Albany district of Grahamstown. They arrived at the start of the Sixth Frontier War, prompting Frederick to volunteer his services. This date marks the first of his 'Aquila Caricatures', a series of informative though jocularly offensive barbs directed at Andries Stockenström, the lieutenant governor of British Kaffraria at the time.\nThe patrons of I'Ons were largely military types who commissioned portraits of the local Xhosa chiefs, such as Sandile and Khama. I'Ons was outstanding in depicting the Bantu and Hottentot passers-by. The images of these 'native characters' are regarded as his most important works, reflecting a great deal of sensitivity and skill in their portrayal, and likened to those of Adriaen van Ostade. As is often the case with artists who have to produce potboilers to survive, their best work is neglected in the interests of financial exigencies.Except for his short association with John Francis, I'Ons had no formal training in art. Still, his landscapes of the Eastern Cape have the charm usually encountered in naïve art with woodland scenes reminiscent of Watteau. Even so, his landscapes are sometimes criticised as being gloomy and uninspired. He eked out his income by painting stage decor, portraits of notable Grahamstown residents and giving art classes. A trip to the diamond diggings at Kimberley did not improve his fortunes.\nHis works provide an important insight into frontier life in the 1800s, and have been exhibited by the Tate Gallery in London (1948), the South African National Gallery in Cape Town (1976), and King George VI Gallery in Port Elizabeth (1990).

He turned to his immediate neighborhood in and around the boulevard de Clichy in Montmartre, Paris, for inspiration for his prints of everyday city life. Buhot delighted in portraying the varied street life of the vibrant capital city not only in different seasons (Winter in Paris, 1879) but also in moments of public display, from a festive holiday celebration (National Holiday on the Boulevard de Clichy, 1878) to a somber death observance (Funeral Procession on the Boulevard de Clichy, 1887). His city views also include London scenes (Westminster Palace and Westminster Bridge, both of 1884). And Buhot's love for the sea is evidenced in the many prints exploring its ever-changing atmospheric conditions and moods.

He contributed to the decoration of San Rocco (1675, 1676, 1678), where he painted a large canvas of the Charity of St Roch on the ceiling of the nave, In his smaller paintings, however, such as the modelli (Florence, Uffizi) painted for the patron  Ferdinand de Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany, for whom he worked for a long time, with Niccolò Cassana acting as intermediary, Fumiani revealed a lively decorative sense and a taste for animated, sensual subjects that produced works of great quality. \nBetween 1684 and 1704, Fumiani decorated the ceiling of San Pantalon in Venice (Chiesa di San Pantaleone Martire) with what has been claimed to be the largest painting on canvas in the world.

When in 1845 his mother, Mary Anne Thomas, married Andrew Wallis, a prosperous London architect, Henry took his stepfather's surname. His artistic training was thorough and influential. He was admitted as a probationer to the RA and enrolled in the Painting School in March 1848. He also studied in Paris at Charles Gleyre's atelier and at the Academie des Beaux Arts, sometime between 1849 and 1853.\n\nWallis is best remembered for his first great success, The Death of Chatterton, which he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1856. The painting depicted the impoverished late 18th-century poet Thomas Chatterton, who poisoned himself in despair at the age of seventeen, and was considered a Romantic hero for many young and struggling artists in Wallis's day. His method and style in Chatterton reveal the importance of his connection to the Pre-Raphaelite movement, seen in the vibrant colours and careful build-up of symbolic detail. He used a bold colour scheme with a contrasting palette and he exploited the fall of the natural light through the window of the garret to implement his much loved style at the time, chiaroscuro. The size of Chatterton's garret was only fractionally larger than the scope of the painting, with room for Wallis and his easel and little else during the preliminary sketches, which were done on-site. The painting is 25x37\" and is in the Tate Britain, with other versions in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and the Yale Center for British Art. There may have been more examples of Chatterton as it was popular and when Wallis had to pay the rent he would paint another version. He once said that dead poets are more saleable than dead labourers (referring to The Stonebreaker, his next major work). The Stonebreaker (1857, exhibited in 1858) consolidated his reputation as a true Pre-Raphaelite. In total, he showed 35 exhibits at the RA, but later in life developed a greater interest in watercolour painting. He was elected a full member of the RWS (Royal Watercolour Society) in 1878 and exhibited over 80 watercolours at the society.\nThe model for his acclaimed The Death of Chatterton was the young George Meredith, whose first wife Mary Ellen would later run off with Wallis.\nWallis' method of painting, especially in the early years of his career, and in particular on \"Death of Chatterton\", was to do the initial sketch, saturate it in water, use a grey tint to block in the shade, put on the colour and allow it to dry. When firm, he would use a hair pencil to add in the details, for which he is so renowned. For the light, he would touch the area in question with water and then rub it with a piece of bread. His studio during these years was in Chelsea, a very bohemian and out of the way part of London at the time.\nHe died, almost blind, at 1 Walpole Road, Croydon, on 20 December 1916.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Henry Wallis", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1830", 27]]], "3_death": [[["1916", 46]]], "4_nationality": [[["British", 58]]]}}

He spent most of it in the town of 's-Hertogenbosch, where he was born in his grandfather's house. The roots of his forefathers are in Nijmegen and Aachen (which is visible in his surname: Van Aken). His pessimistic and fantastical style cast a wide influence on northern art of the 16th century, with Pieter Bruegel the Elder being his best-known follower. Today he is seen as a hugely individualistic painter with deep insight into humanity's desires and deepest fears. Attribution has been especially difficult; today only about 25 paintings are confidently given to his hand along with eight drawings. About another half dozen paintings are confidently attributed to his workshop. His most acclaimed works consist of a few triptych altarpieces, including The Garden of Earthly Delights.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Hieronymus Bosch", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1450", 126]]], "3_death": [[["1516", 142]]], "4_nationality": [[["Early Netherlandish", 249], ["Dutch", 30]]]}}

His ancestral home was She County, Anhui province. He was the grandson of artist Huang Fengliu. He would later be associated with Shanghai and finally Hangzhou. He is considered one of the last innovators in the literati style of painting and is noted for his freehand landscapes.\nHis early painting style showed the influence of Li Liufang (李流芳), Cheng Sui, Cheng Zhengkui, Kun Can, Hong Ren and the Yuan and Ming masters. It emphasized on the importance of the unification of positive and negative space; dark and light shades. Each brush line is powerful and precise. The compact touches, the graceful outlines and the elegant styles of Xin’an School of painting (新安画派) had a profound influence on Huang throughout his life. His style before the age of sixty is called the White-period.After sixty years old, Huang went to Guichi. The scenery of Guichi not only attracted the artist, but also had a great impact on his style. Huang changed from focusing on brush and line to focusing on ink and wash. He started to practice the painting style of Wu Zhen. In 1928, Huang visited Guangxi and Guangdong and created a lot of works by sketching the real landscapes. Huang started to transit from his “White style” to “Black style”.At the age of sixty nine to seventy, Huang visited Sichuan. He was inspired by the atmosphere of Mount Qingcheng in rain and the Qutang Gorge under moonlight. He utilized dripping, staining and layers of dense ink to illustrate the misty wet feeling of rain and the nightly view of mountains. Since then, his \"black, dense, thick, heavy\" style became his significant feature.From 1937 to 1948, Huang lived in Beijing for eleven years and most of his Black period paintings were done during that time.  After that, he moved to Hangzhou and started another new horizon in his art. Inspired by Western Impressionism, he integrated the two major Chinese painting systems (Ink and wash painting and color painting) into a unity. Dots of red, green and blue pigment merged with layers of dense ink creating a luxuriant and richly integrated style in which he deftly manipulated solid and void.  \nHis varied style and creativity not only won him an honorary title, but also brought light into the modern Chinese art history.He also had significance for creating several societies devoted to painting and calligraphy.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Huang Binhong", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1865", 29]]], "3_death": [[["1955", 34]]], "4_nationality": [[["Chinese", 15]]]}}

During his career he taught school in Chester and Lancaster Counties, but by around 1786 he had moved with his entire family to Upper Mount Bethel Township in Northampton County, where he took a position at the Lutheran school. The family moved again in 1801, settling in Hamilton Township, Monroe County; there, at Christ Hamilton Lutheran Church, he became a schoolteacher and a clerk. He never married and remained in Hamilton Township until his death; during his career he taught in Mennonite schools as well as Lutheran. Eyer was the eldest son of the family, and in this position presided over the estate of his parents. With his brother Ludwig acting as agent, he founded and developed the town of Bloomsburg in 1802. Another brother, Johann Frederick, was a schoolmaster and organist who also produced fraktur. Eyer was friends as well with Andreas Kolb, another fraktur artist and Mennonite minister, with whom he exchanged artworks. In addition to his teaching activities, he was a successful businessman.Eyer produced hundreds of pieces of fraktur during his career, initially copying pieces produced by Mennonite or Schwenkfelder artists who created writing samples for their students. These he would fold to make a booklet, with four pages and a cover. Cutting a larger sheet in half lengthwise allowed him to produce a book of musical notation, a skill which he passed on to his pupils as well. Later in life he also produced hymnal bookplates, baptismal records, and presentation drawings, as well as illustrated poems. Also extant is a drawing of a soldier's wedding. The Mennonite Heritage Center owns several of his works. Three works are held by the American Folk Art Museum, while fourteen may be found in the collection of the Winterthur Museum.

He wrote on subjects as varied as geology, architecture, myth, ornithology, literature, education, botany and political economy.\nHis writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. He wrote essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, architectural structures and ornamentation.\nThe elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art gave way in time to plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society.\nHe was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century and up to the First World War. After a period of relative decline, his reputation has steadily improved since the 1960s with the publication of numerous academic studies of his work. Today, his ideas and concerns are widely recognised as having anticipated interest in environmentalism, sustainability and craft.\nRuskin first came to widespread attention with the first volume of Modern Painters (1843), an extended essay in defence of the work of J. M. W. Turner in which he argued that the principal role of the artist is \"truth to nature\". From the 1850s, he championed the Pre-Raphaelites, who were influenced by his ideas. His work increasingly focused on social and political issues. Unto This Last (1860, 1862) marked the shift in emphasis. In 1869, Ruskin became the first Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Oxford, where he established the Ruskin School of Drawing. In 1871, he began his monthly \"letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain\", published under the title Fors Clavigera (1871–1884). In the course of this complex and deeply personal work, he developed the principles underlying his ideal society.

Vaughan was self-taught as an artist. His first exhibitions took place during the war. In 1942 he was stationed at Ashton Gifford near Codford in Wiltshire, and paintings from this time include The Wall at Ashton Gifford (Manchester Art Gallery).\nAlso during the war Vaughan formed friendships with the painters Graham Sutherland and John Minton, with whom after demobilisation in 1946 he shared premises. Through these contacts he formed part of the neo-romantic circle of the immediate post-war period. However, Vaughan rapidly developed an idiosyncratic style which moved him away from the Neo-Romantics. Concentrating on studies of male figures, his works became increasingly abstract.\nVaughan worked as an art teacher at the Camberwell College of Arts, the Central School of Art and later at the Slade School.\nVaughan is also known for his journals, selections from which were published in 1966 and more extensively in 1989, after his death.

In the history of Croatian painting he is best known for his landscapes of his home county, Međimurje, and Zagorje, which he created throughout his entire life. Although during his lifetime his art was little known to other artists and art critics, today it has been recognized that the works of Kralj-Međimurec represent a valuable contribution to the history of Croatian visual arts of the twentieth century.The artist was born as Ladislav Kralj in Čakovec in 1891. He decided to take the name Međimurec as a sign of love for his native soil. Kralj-Međimurec began his artistic education at the academy in Budapest in 1910, which he was forced to abandon in 1912 because he was recruited for the army. During the First World War, he was sent to the front, where he was wounded. After his recovery at the hospital in Miskolec, he returned to Čakovec, where he met Ivan Novak, a literary writer and active local politician who helped him continue with his studies. Kralj-Međimurec finished his education at the academy in Vienna (1922–1924) under the tutorship of Rudolf Jettmar.\n\nIn his earliest works from the early 1920s, Kralj-Međimurec rejected any type of idealization and painted his canvases using wide brushstrokes. During his studies in Vienna, he started the collection of etchings depicting his hometown Čakovec, which he finished and exhibited in 1926 at the Ulrich Gallery in Zagreb. From 1926 to 1929 he worked as an art teacher in Karlovac and Nova Gradiška, until he was offered the same position at the grammar school in Varaždin. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, he created two more collections of etchings, “Dalmacija” (1926–1928) and “Varaždin” (1929–1932), and painted canvases depicting social themes (“Radnici na pruzi”, 1927, “Međimurka”, 1933), whose quality kept pace with the works of contemporary Croatian artists of critical realism.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Kralj-Međimurec lived solitarily in a small village of Krkanec near Varaždin, where he devoted most of his time to painting landscapes, which remained his most dominant theme until his death in 1976. During the early 1940s, he worked with dark tones of brown, green, and yellow, applying them onto the canvas using wide strokes (“Zagorsko dvorište”, “Stari škedenj”). After the war, he moved back to Čakovec, where his art took a new turn. During the so-called Šenkovec phase (1946–1956), he began to paint his landscapes using short strokes of impasto – often applying it directly with a painting-knife – which gave his canvases a granulated effect (“Seosko dvorište”, 1954). During the next two phases, the so-called Mihovljan (1956–1961) and Štrigova phase (1961–1968), the form of his landscapes gradually became simpler, and his way of painting changed from using blotches of paint to creating planes of colour, giving his landscapes a post-impressionist touch (“Štrigova” and “Gornje Međimurje”, 1961).\nDuring his last years, Kralj-Međimurec continued to experiment with the form of his landscapes, moving even closer to abstraction (“Bezimeno cvijeće”).

She was strongly influenced by Abstract Expressionism, which she was exposed to at the exhibition of foreign artists held during the World Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow (1957).Masterkova studied under Mikhail Perutski at the Moscow Secondary School of Art (1943–46), the Vasily Surikov School of Art (1946) and Moscow Regional School of Art (1947–50). A dedicated abstractionist, Masterkova was associated with the Lianozovo Group, a diverse group of artists and poets who fought steadfastly and uncompromisingly for creative freedom. One of these artists, Vladimir Nemukhin, lived with her, although they never married.\nOne of the significant personalities in the Moscow art world of the 1960s, Masterkova's work at the beginning of that decade included loosely painted watercolors in bright colors. Soon after, she darkened her palette and in the mid 1960s, her work was characterized by abstract compositions created with a palette knife in which dark, craggy forms contrasted with a light background. By the end of the decade, she began incorporating lace and brocade collected from abandoned churches into her compositions. She felt these items were filled with a kind of mysticism.In the early 1970s, these dark, brooding forms were still in evidence, but superimposed by collages of white circles bearing the numerals 0, 1, and 9. She also created subtle, circular, black and white compositions by manipulating India ink or watercolor on wet paper, often affixing collage elements cut out of white paper.\nDuring this period, Masterkova contributed to apartment exhibitions in Russia, foreign exhibitions, and the first shows of nonconformist art, including the first autumnal review, \"In the open air\" (\"Bulldozer Exhibition\") in 1974 in Belyayevo. Shortly afterwards, in 1975, she moved with her son to France, where she worked with the Galerie Dina Vierny in Paris (1976) and held a one-woman show called Adieu à la Russie (1977).\n\nLydia Masterkova tended to work in cycles and series, the most famous of which is \"Planets\" (1976). Her work resides in numerous museums and private collections, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Zimmerli Art Museum in New Jersey, and the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, which held a retrospective of her work in 2006.\nShe died in 2008 at the age of 81 and was buried in Saint-Laurent-sur-Othain in Lorraine.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Lidiya Masterkova", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1927", 70]]], "3_death": [[["2008", 100]]], "4_nationality": [[["Russian", 43], ["French", 149]]]}}

On the outbreak of the War of 1812 the family returned to the United States, only to leave a few years later for Bordeaux, where they stayed until 1830. It is in Bordeaux that Louisa Strobel was taught to paint, though it is unknown who her teacher was. Her style is reminiscent of the work of the Franco-American miniature painter Louis Antoine Collas, but there is no evidence they ever met. The museum in Bordeaux has many similar miniature portraits by anonymous painters, so it is possible there was a school there of some sort. Like many well-to-do young women painters of her time, she was not commercially active and her works were kept in the family.\nAccording to her \"memorial\" written by Samuel D. Burchard for the Proceedings of the Twenty-First Convocation of the University of the State of New York (held July 10, 11 and 12, 1883) on the request of her son, Daniel Strobel Martin, she lived in Liverpool next door to the Gladstone family and played with the older brother of the later prime minister William Ewart Gladstone. During her time in France she learned French and became acquainted with French literature and the arts. After returning to the US, her father became deputy collector in the Custom House. In January 1831 he wrote a report with recommendations on the consular service of the United States that is seen as a valuable source that gives insight into the history of US foreign relations. After her father died in 1839 Louisa married the ten-year-younger Benjamin Nicholas Martin who was a divinity student she met in New Haven, Connecticut. He became a clergyman and she travelled with him to Massachusetts and Albany, before settling in New York City where he became professor of philosophy at the University of the State of New York. It is believed that she stopped painting after marriage.Her works are held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, donated by her grand-niece Ella Church Strobell, and the Gibbes Museum of Art (Carolina Art Association), donated by her son. The Metropolitan also has miniature portraits by John Vanderlyn of her parents. These were painted before Louisa was born and she would have been familiar with them all her life.

He was one of the central members of Novemberists, a group of Finnish expressionists.Collin  was born in Helsinki in educated, Swedish-speaking family. His father was a civil servant. Becoming an artist was not obvious for Collin. He studied law, but did not want to become a civil servant in Finland as A Grand Duchy ruled by  Russia. He worked as a journalist, and tried to study architecture, but the mathematics classes were too challenging for him. Then he changed  his studies to study art, first in Helsinki later in Paris. He made four elongated trips in continental Europe, and on his fourth visit to Paris he enrolled in Académie Ranson where he was taught by Paul Sérusier. Sérusier drew his attention to composition, and for a while even the use of colour in Collin's work shows influence of Sérusier. The paintings of life in archipelago painted in bright colours were Collin's final breakthrough as an artist.Collin became a member of group of artists led by Tyko Sallinen. The group took later the name November Group. In middle of 1910-decade the group started to use more ascetic palettes, and the colour scale of Collin was the most minimal of them all. He only used a few dark shades.After 1921, Collin gradually abandoned his gray and brown palette by adding more bright colours. When he became older, his style became more realistic.Collin is known for his paintings of people. Many of these illustrate literature, such as the Aleksis Kivi novel Seitsemän veljestä or the Miguel de Cervantes novel Don Quixote. He portrayed factory workers and farmhands as faceless representatives of their social class.Collin was given an honorary title of professor in 1953.

He is known for his ability to weave a tapestry of art historical influences with modernist elements and a contemporary sensibility. His work frequently dances the line of Surrealism and Expressionism, often with a pop and op art edge, incorporating aspects of primitive, Romantic, and Renaissance art. He has worked in a wide variety of media from miniature etchings to oversized oils on canvas. These have included woodcuts, lithographs, etchings and engravings with aquatint and soft ground, monotypes, gouache and watercolor paintings, and oils. He is also known for his technical skill and innovation.\n \nBarooshian is a restless innovator with work that has moved through many periods with varying styles and transitions. However, Barooshian defines himself as a Biomorphic Abstract Surrealist after his first personal artistic breakthrough and mature style. Cate McQuaid--art critic for The Boston Globe--dubbed Barooshian’s biomorphic surrealist style as “Pablo Picasso meets Stan Lee,” recognizing the blend of the modern with the contemporary. Further, she recognized that Barooshian held firm to his own artistic vision and was “not a follower of fashions” but instead “has always defined his own style…against the grain of the art scene.”Barooshian has enjoyed a 70-year career as an artist and continues to actively create new works. Susan Faxon, Associate Director and Curator of the Addison Gallery of American Art, summed up her experience of reviewing Barooshian’s oeuvre: “It was clear that [Barooshian] had devoted a lifetime to the making of art and that he was still fully engaged on a daily basis in the creative process. So too it was clear that here was an artist whose sweep was wide, whose influences and interests were many, whose output was prodigious, and whose exuberance, inventiveness, imagination, and artistic commitment was boundless.“A catalogue raisonne of Barooshian’s prints from 1948-1970 has been completed.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Martin Barooshian", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1929", 24]]], "3_death": [], "4_nationality": [[["American", 60]]]}}

Aged about eighteen, she took a position as a cook at Lenoir-Rhyne College in Hickory. There she performed numerous housekeeping duties; she also learned to sew, which she would do for people around the county.

The family home burned to the ground in 1932, and the family lived in the granary until a new home could be constructed.By 1974 Reinhardt's vision had become so reduced by cataracts that she was unable to distinguish shapes and colors. Surgery restored her sight, and the experience pushed her to begin painting once more, using oil paints given to her by her daughter Arie Taylor. As a painter she was entirely self-taught. Her works depict a variety of daily activities remembered from her youth. She painted daily at a small desk in front of a window in her home, and was extremely prolific before her death. Her husband made frames for many of her finished paintings. Reinhardt and her husband are buried in the cemetery of Corinth Baptist Church in Vale.Reinhardt was the subject of an exhibit at the Hickory Museum of Art in 1996.

He was the younger son of the painter Pandit Seu and, like his older brother Manaku of Guler, was an important practitioner of Pahari painting, and has been called \"one of the most original and brilliant of Indian painters\".Around 1740 he left the family workshop in Guler and moved to Jasrota, where he painted most of his works for the local Rajput ruler Mian Zorowar Singh and his son Balwant Singh until the latter's death in 1763. This is the best known and documented phase of his career.  Through his adaptation of elements of Mughal painting, he was a central force in the development of Pahari painting in the middle of the eighteenth century, bringing Mughal elements into what had been a school mainly concerned with Hindu religious subjects.  In his final phase at Basholi, from about 1765 until his death in 1778, Nainsukh returned to religious subject matter, but retaining his stylistic innovations.  By the end of his career, with an active family workshop continuing his style, he was probably not executing the works himself anymore, but leaving them to his children and nephew as his artistic heirs.  Such works are often ascribed to the Family of Nainsukh.According to B.N. Goswamy, the leading scholar of Nainsukh, \"Devices and mannerisms associated with Nainsukh include: a preference for uncoloured grounds; shading through a light wash that imparts volume and weight to figures and groups; a fine horizontal line that separates ground from background; a rich green in which his landscapes are usually bathed; a bush with flat circular leaves that he often introduces; a peculiar loop of the long stem of a hooka; and a minor figure often introduced in a two-thirds profile.\"Although a great part of his work may be lost, around a hundred works by Nainsukh survive, many in both Indian and Western museums. Four of these bear his signature, and several have inscribed titles or comments.  Unusually for Pahari painting, some are dated. There are at least two self-portraits, one from early in his career, and the other in a group scene with Balwant Singh, who is looking at a miniature, with the artist seated below him. Nainsukh peers over the raja's shoulder, perhaps offering his comments on the work, or ready to do so.'\nA film based on his life was created by Amit Dutta in 2010.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Nainsukh", 0]]], "2_birth": [], "3_death": [[["1778", 49]]], "4_nationality": [[["Indian", 62]]]}}

{"docid": "Wikipedia-27907", "doctext": "Omar Onsi (1901-1969) (Arabic: عمر أنسي‎); was a pioneer of modern painting in Lebanon and Lebanon's most renowned impressionist painter.\nHe was born in Tallet Al-Khayat, Beirut in 1901. His father, Dr. Abdul Rahman El Ounsi, was a prominent general practitioner, had been one of the first Beirut Muslims to study modern Western medicine and his mother came from the prominent Sunni Muslim family Salam, who notably dressed in Western attire. He was named after his paternal grandfather, the scholarly poet, Omar, who was well known in Beirut.After an attempt to study medicine, Onsi studied painting in Beirut with Khalil Saleeby at his atelier across the street from Beirut University.In around 1922, he travelled to Amman in Jordan, where he settled for a number of years (1922-1927), and taught painting and English to the children of King Abdullah. His career subsequently benefited from the patronage of the Jordanian King. The discovery of the desert and its colours during this stay in Amman had a major influence on his work. During this time, he also documented the indigenous peoples, both ethnographically and visually.In 1928, Onsi went to Paris to continue his training and stayed for 3 years, attending the Académie Julian and different workshops. During that period, Onsi focused on painting portraits, nudes, and Parisian scenery. While in Paris, he met the painter, Georges Cyr and the  sculptor, Youssef El-Houwayek, with whom he became a lifelong friend. He also met his first wife, Ema, in Paris.In 1930, following the untimely death of his first wife, he travelled to Al Suwayda in Syria for a period of mourning. In 1933, he returned to Lebanon, bringing back a colorful impressionist palette and a French second wife. From then on, his work focused on the Lebanese landscape. A Lebanese woman, known simply as Grandma Kamal, visited Onsi at his Tallet Al-Khayat property in the late 1930s, and recalled that there were many gazelles roaming about. Gazelles featured prominently in his paintings.He held his first solo exhibition at the School of Arts and Crafts in Beirut in 1932. At that time, the market for Western-influenced art was emerging as the educated middle-classes and elites began to purchase works by local artists. From the outset, Onsi charged relatively high prices for his paintings - 5,000 francs for an allegory, 1,000 for a portrait and around 200 francs for a landscape. However, the landscapes were more popular with the Lebanese elites, and Osni soon began producing landscapes in much greater numbers and began charging higher prices for them. Before long, he was receiving an average price of 500 francs for a landscape. The local press quickly touted him as a skilled paysagiste, a title that soon launched his career.Onsi continued to travel throughout he 1940s and 50s, and exhibited his work in Germany, Spain, Italy, and Egypt. He died on 3 June 1969 in Beirut, after suffering from stomach cancer.Along with artists, Mustafa Farrukh (1901-1957), César Gemayel (Qaisarr Jumayil) (1898-1958), Saliba Douaihy (Saliba Duwaihi) (b. 1915) and Rachid Wehbi (Rachid Wahbah)(b. 1917), Osni is regarded as a pioneer, having laid the foundations for a modern arts movement in Lebanon.

He became famous in Europe for his melodramatic depictions that often portrayed subjects from English and French history. The emotions emphasised in Delaroche's paintings appeal to Romanticism while the detail of his work along with the deglorified portrayal of historic figures follow the trends of Academicism and Neoclassicism. Delaroche aimed to depict his subjects and history with pragmatic realism. He did not consider popular ideals and norms in his creations, but rather painted all his subjects in the same light whether they were historical figures like Marie-Antoinette, figures of Christianity, or people of his time like Napoleon Bonaparte. Delaroche was a leading pupil of Antoine-Jean Gros and later mentored a number of notable artists such as Thomas Couture, Jean-Léon Gérôme, and Jean-François Millet.\nDelaroche was born into a generation that saw the stylistic conflicts between Romanticism and Davidian Classicism. Davidian Classicism was widely accepted and enjoyed by society so as a developing artist at the time of the introduction of Romanticism in Paris, Delaroche found his place between the two movements. Subjects from Delaroche's medieval and sixteenth and seventeenth-century history paintings appealed to Romantics while the accuracy of information along with the highly finished surfaces of his paintings appealed to Academics and Neoclassicism. Delaroche's works completed in the early 1830s most reflected the position he took between the two movements and were admired by contemporary artists of the time—the Execution of Lady Jane Grey (1833; National Gallery, London) was the most acclaimed of Delaroche's paintings in its day. Later in the 1830s, Delaroche exhibited the first of his major religious works. His change of subject and “the painting’s austere manner” were ill-received by critics and after 1837, he stopped exhibiting his work altogether. At the time of his death in 1856, he was painting a series of four scenes from the Life of the Virgin.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-29880", "doctext": "Polidoro de Rienzo da Lanciano (Lanciano, 1515 - 1565) was an Italian painter.\nRelatively little is known of his life.  He was born in Lanciano, a town that is a few miles inland from Ortona, a port on the Adriatic Sea. This is in the Abruzzi region of Italy, lying southeast of Pescara. His grandfather, Alessandro Rienzo, was a ceramic painter in Lanciano. Based on Venetian documents Polydoro's birthdate is taken to be 1515.  At an early age he apparently showed great artistic talent. and for that reason he moved to Venice, the center of art in that region of Italy, at a young age.  There he assumed a Venetian form for his name, Lanzani.   His first mention in official Venetian documents is 1536, when he would have been 21 years of age.  He probably came to Venice at least five years prior to that in order to begin his artistic training.  His name appears as a witness to a document in the years 1536 and 1549.  His Last Will and Testament bears his signature, and is dated 20 July 1565.  He died the following day, with his age reported as 50.  He likely worked as an assistant to Titian (c.1488/90-1576) for many years, especially given the close resemblance of his style with that of the Venetian master.  This would have been in the 1530s and possibly early 1540s.  It is not known whether he then set up his own studio, but that was common practice.

His knowledge of ships is evident from his work: ships and foreign locations are depicted with high accuracy and in great detail, and served as an example to other artists of how to depict ships.\nA widely traveled artist, Nooms visited Paris, Venice and possibly Berlin, and also journeyed along the coast of North Africa.\nA favourite subject of his paintings were the Dutch victories in the Anglo-Dutch Wars. For instance, he painted the Amalia, the flagship of admiral Maarten Tromp, before the Battle of the Downs in 1639. This painting now hangs in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, UK. His painting of the Battle of Leghorn in 1653 is in the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.\nIn the 1650s, Nooms made a series of etchings of ships and topographical views characterized by a high degree of detail and precision. These etchings served as an example to many artists. The 19th century French etcher Charles Meryon was highly influenced by Nooms, whose etchings of Paris cityscapes inspired him to his own series of Paris etchings. Meryon dedicated some of these works to Nooms in poetic form.\nOne of Nooms' final works, from 1664, shows a view of the Amsterdam harbour, with the IJ bay and the naval depot's Lands Zeemagazijn, now the home of the Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum (Netherlands Maritime Museum).

{"docid": "Wikipedia-32893", "doctext": "Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late International Gothic period. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence.Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.\n\nLochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral. One of Dürer's diary entries became key, 400 years later, in the 20th-century establishment of Lochner's identity. Only two attributed works are dated, and none are signed. His influence on successive generations of northern artists was substantial. Apart from the many direct copies made in the later 15th century, echoes of his panels can be seen in works by Rogier van der Weyden and Hans Memling. Lochner's work was praised by Friedrich Schlegel and Goethe for its qualities, especially the \"sweetness and grace\" of his Madonnas.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Stefan Lochner", 0]]], "2_birth": [], "3_death": [[["1451", 68]]], "4_nationality": [[["German", 80]]]}}

{"docid": "Wikipedia-34892", "doctext": "Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsənt ˈʋɪləm vɑŋ ˈɣɔx] (listen); 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness, depression and poverty.\nBorn into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet, and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two kept a long correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.\nVan Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression continued, and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a Lefaucheux revolver. He died from his injuries two days later.\nVan Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime, and he was considered a madman and a failure. He became famous after his suicide and exists in the public imagination as a misunderstood genius, the artist \"where discourses on madness and creativity converge\". His reputation began to grow in the early 20th century as elements of his painting style came to be incorporated by the Fauves and German Expressionists. He attained widespread critical, commercial and popular success over the ensuing decades, and he is remembered as an important but tragic painter, whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist. Today, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings to have ever sold, and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Vincent van Gogh", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1853", 78]]], "3_death": [[["1890", 93]]], "4_nationality": [[["Dutch", 25]]]}}

He is a member of the \"Allusive Abstractionists,\" an informal group of Chicago painters self-named in 1981, whose paradoxical styles countered the reductive minimalism that dominated post-1960s art. In 1982, critic Mary Mathews Gedo hailed them as \"prescient prophets of the new style of abstraction\" that flowered in the 1980s. In his essay for Conger's fifty-year career retrospective, Donald Kuspit called Conger art-historically daring for forging a path of subjective abstraction after minimalism had allegedly purged painting of an inner life. Despite being abstract, his work has a strong connection to Chicago's urban, lakeside geography and displays idiosyncratic variations of tendencies identified with Chicago Imagist art. A hallmark of Conger's career has been his enduring capacity for improvisation and discovery within self-prescribed stylistic limits.Conger has shown at the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (MCA), the Krannert Art Museum, and Jonson Museum, and in numerous solo exhibitions in Chicago and beyond. His work has been discussed widely in national publications such as Artforum, Art in America, Arts Magazine, and ARTnews, and major dailies including the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times. He has been recognized by the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, City of Chicago Public Commissions, inclusion in the Smithsonian Archives of American Art, and purchases by  public and private collections.
