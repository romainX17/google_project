Mintchine greatest artwork was produced mostly while in Paris and la Garde, between 1926 and 1931. He is known for vibrant paintings (close to expressionism) where mysticism is also often present.\n\nMintchine was born in Kyiv where at age 13 he was an apprenticed to a goldsmith. He began painting from the age of 16 and studied at the Kyiv Art College (together with Josyf Weissblatt, Olexandr Tyshler) and at Olexandra Exter. Later he left Ukraine for Berlin in 1923. In Berlin he designed sets and costumes for the Jewish theatre. At the time of his first exhibition in Berlin he displayed artwork in a style close to Cubism (only one painting from this period is known).\nMintchine's most prolific and self-defining period started when he arrived in Paris around 1925. There he developed an exalted style, through dense and vibrant compositions. Mintchine's life was not easy. In extreme poverty and married with a child, he nonetheless succeeded to develop a very characteristic style. On a number of occasions, Mintchine integrates mysticism in his compositions (often representations of Angels or angelic elements such as wings). \nLater, in 1929, the art dealer René Gimpel identified Mintchine as a \"genius\" painter and start buying all his paintings. About Mintchine's condition, he wrote in his journal: \"he barely managed to scrape a 100 sous to live on; he wouldn't eat, and, dying of hunger would say to his wife: 'Eat, Mintchine isn't hungry'.\"\n\nMintchine's art reflects an exceptional intensity. He inspires feelings reminiscent of Chaim Soutine's artwork (with which he shared the same Jewish identity and Russian-French cultures). However, Mintchine's artwork is less tormented than Soutine's, conveying passion through great poetry (often via mystical elements). Mintchine's life was even shorter than the former: suffering from tubercolosis, he died at only 33 of a brain aneurysm while painting The Hill with Red Flowers  (La Garde,1931).\n\nHe is considered as one of the greatest artists of the period between the First and Second World Wars and is often associated to the Jewish School of Paris.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1898", 27]]], "death": [[["1931", 43]]], "nationality": [[["Russian", 1746], ["French", 1754]]], "painter_name": [[["Abraham Mintchine", 0]]]}}

Russia intended to enforce its claims by sending two warships to the disputed areas. When the two countries agreed on 54°40′N as the southern limit of Russian claims, Czar Nicolas I changed their orders in 1826 to an extended three-year survey of the Russian-American and Asian coasts.\nOtto von Kotzebue had returned on 10 July 1826 from his voyage of discovery aboard Predpriyatiye. On 16 August 1826, Captain Lieutenant Fedor Petrovich Litke, sailed on board the Russian vessel Senyavin, accompanied by the Möller under Captain Lieutenant M. N. Staniukovich. Postels sailed with Litke as a naturalist/artist and had the distinction of being the first St. Petersburg University graduate to join such a large-scale expedition. On board were also the naturalist Karl Heinrich Mertens (1796-1830), who died in Kronstadt shortly after his return from Iceland and another trip on the Senyavin, and the ornithologist Baron von Kittlitz.\n\nTheir orders were to\n\"reconnoitre and describe the coasts of Kamchatka, the land of the Chuchkis and the Koriaks (the coasts of which have not yet been described by anyone, and which are unknown except by the voyage of Captain Bering); the coasts of the Okhotsk Sea, and the Shantar Islands, which although they are known to us, have not been sufficiently described.\"\nThe expedition sailed from Kronstadt, the Russian port on Kotlin Island, via Portsmouth and rounded Cape Horn on 24 February 1827. The Senyavin called at Concepcion in Chile, before sailing north to Sitka, and arriving at Petropavlovsk in mid-September. They explored the Caroline Islands and the Bonin-Jima group for four months, returning to Kamchatka in May. During the summer they sailed from Avacha Bay to Karaginskii Island and on through the Bering Strait to reconnoitre the coast as far north as the Anadyr River. They returned via Manila and the Cape of Good Hope, arriving back in Kronstadt on 16 September 1829.The expedition was called the largest and most productive voyage of discovery of the era, and brought back some 4 000 natural history specimens, including mammals, insects, birds, plants, and minerals. More than 1250 sketches of their findings were made on the voyage. Twelve island groups were discovered along the Asian coast, and 26  Caroline Islands were explored and described. The flattening of the Earth's poles was investigated using an invariable pendulum. Postels was appointed assistant-professor of the Department of Mineralogy and Geology of St.Petersburg University. During the voyage Postels depicted more than 100 seaweeds or marine algae from the northern Pacific in \"Illustrationes algarum in itinere circa orbem jussu Imperatoriis Nicolai I\" published in St. Petersburg in 1840. The seaweed genus Postelsia is named in his honour. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Postels when citing a botanical name.Postels was elected an Honorary Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences on 14 January 1866 and invited to act as curator of the Mineralogical Museum.

During a brief sojourn in Poland, 1695–96, he painted portraits of John III Sobieski and Polish aristocrats; after the king's death Desportes returned to Paris, convinced that he should specialise in animals and flowers. He was received by the Académie de peinture et de sculpture in 1699, with the Self-Portrait in Hunting Dress now in the Musée du Louvre. In 1712–13 he spent six months in England. He received many commissions for decorative panels for the royal châteaux: Versailles, Marly, Meudon, Compiègne and, his last royal commission, for Louis XV at Choisy, 1742. He also did decorative paintings for the duc de Bourbon at Chantilly. Both Louis XIV and Louis XV commissioned portraits of their favorite hunting dogs.\nDesportes would follow the royal hunt with a small notebook he carried to make on-site sketches for still lives of the game that resulted from the day's hunt, for the king to make a choice of which were to be worked up into finished paintings. In several paintings he combined game with a buffet of spectacular pieces of silver as they might be displayed in a dining room; these are precious documents of the lost silver of the reign of Louis XIV.\nHis details of trophies of game or animals were used in cartoons for tapestry in which work of several painters was combined, woven at the Savonnerie and at the Gobelins (Portière de Diane, Louvre). For the Gobelins he designed the series of tapestries called Les Nouvelles Indes (8 of them, woven in the Manufacture Les Gobelins in Paris, have been saved in Archbishop's palace in Prague).\nAt his death, in Paris, he left a considerable amount of work in his studio (where his nephew Nicolas had trained), which included studies of animals and plants as well as some fox-hunting sketches by Jan Fyt. In 1784, the comte d'Angiviller, general director of the Bâtiments du Roi acquired these resources for painter's models at the manufactory of Sèvres porcelain, so that Desportes' influence in the iconography of French arts extended almost throughout the century.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1661", 42]]], "death": [[["1743", 58]]], "nationality": [[["French", 70]]], "painter_name": [[["Alexandre-François Desportes", 0]]]}}

He created religious works, allegories, portraits as well as genre scenes in the vein of the Caravaggisti.  He also returned regularly to scenes of witchcraft and sorcery.  His style is eclectic style and shows influences principally from Caravaggio and the painters of 'low-life' scenes active in Rome called the Bamboccianti.  His work is characterised by its search for originality.  This is demonstrated in the potent naturalism and chiaroscuro that characterise his compositions and his preference for depicting colorful characters of contemporary Rome and scenes of witchcraft and musicians. The work of Caroselli was influential on other Caravaggisti such as the Lucchese painter Pietro Paolini and the Dutch painter Dirck van Baburen.Despite the Caravaggist influences his work is characterised by its search for originality and a certain resistance to the triumphant absolutism of the Baroque style, which is expressed through some 'archaicizing' leanings in his work.  Caroselli was also active as an art restorer, copyist, and, possibly, forger.  In recent years a corpus of paintings has been attributed to a yet to be identified artist referred to with the notname of Pseudo-Caroselli.  The style of the anonymous artist is so close to that of Caroselli that it is believed that this artist must have been in direct contact with Caroselli.  The resulting similarity in styles has made it difficult to attribute certain works with certainty to either of the two artists.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1585", 43]]], "death": [[["1652", 58]]], "nationality": [[["Italian", 71]]], "painter_name": [[["Angelo Caroselli", 0]]]}}

After service in parishes in the Philippines and in Virginia, the family settled in Petersburg in 1937.In 1935, the city of Petersburg, using W.P.A. (Women's and Professional Division) funds, authorized the creation of a 25-acre wildflower sanctuary in Lee Memorial Park.  Under the direction of Petersburg Garden Club member Mary Donald Claiborne Holden, African American women labored on the project through 1940, clearing ravines, building ten miles of paths, and planting 365,00 plants, including 8,000 trees and 37,000 shrubs and more than one million honeysuckle roots to prevent erosion.  In 1937, Holden hired Marshall to paint watercolors of the dried and pressed plant specimens of Lee Park flora.  A self-taught artist, Marshall produced 238 watercolors of the Lee Park herbarium specimens; the paintings and 325 specimens were stored together in fourteen brown scrapbooks, ultimately housed for almost fifty years in the Petersburg Public Library. The collection was rediscovered by the Petersburg Garden Club in the 1990s.Although she pursued other illustration assignments, Marshall had no other major commissions.  She died on February 14, 1960 in Portsmouth, Virginia.Lee Memorial Park is now on the National Register of Historic Places.  Marshall and the Lee Park W.P.A. project are the subjects of a monograph published in 2000.

Over the course of his education, Mr. Jackson was taught by Max Beckmann, Fred Conway and Abraham Rattner. In addition to the Bureau of Reclamation's commission, Mr. Jackson received several other government commissions. These include paintings for NASA to record the Apollo space program, and paintings in the state capitol buildings of Olympia, Washington and Springfield, Illinois.\nAll of the paintings that he completed for the Bureau of Reclamation are watercolors, however, Mr. Jackson is probably better known for his oils of the Midwest. After beginning in printmaking, specifically woodcuts and lithographs, he made the shift to painting with Still Life with Postage Stamp in 1955. The expressionism and flat, two-dimensional, patterned prints of his earlier years gave way to increasing naturalism. Realism as a reaction against Abstract Expressionism gained a significant following starting in the late 1960s, the most visible of the movement being the photorealists and the super-realists, artists such as Richard Estes and Chuck Close. While Billy Morrow Jackson was certainly painting in a realist manner, his use of ambiguity (imperfect or rough lines, for example) and his use of light for compositional purposes also linked him to the historic American Luminist school of the 19th century. The Luminists tended to depict landscape scenes (in the tradition of John Constable and Joseph M. W. Turner) with a romantic sensibility, much like Jackson was doing. The sky is a dominant feature in many of Jackson's paintings, pushing the horizon line down towards the bottom of the canvas. The empty fields and solitary farm houses impart a sense of vastness and expanse that is enhanced by his use of perspective. Some of Jackson's later works moved indoors, where he exploited walls and doors to impart depth as well as employing perspective.  Jackson's paintings recall the paintings of Andrew Wyeth and Edward Hopper in their use of realism to convey feelings of isolation and vastness.\nJackson died in 2006.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1926", 22]]], "death": [[["2006", 27]]], "nationality": [[["American", 40]]], "painter_name": [[["Billy Morrow Jackson", 0]]]}}

He moved to live in Milan in 1973 to study printmaking and photography at the Scuola Cova, and design with Bruno Munari at the Instituto Politécnico. Zerpa was a self-taught painter, by 1974 he was creating installations and performance pieces. He returned to Venezuela in 1980, but spent two years in New York: (1982 to 1984). By 1984 he ceased performing and concentrated on making objects. His work is in many ways autobiographical. It recalls department store displays cases which serve as stages for his homages to the past. \nZerpa also trained in design, photography and printmaking, paintings, drawings, sculptures, performances and installations, He exhibited internationally and won many awards. Carlos Zerpa trained in Italy, Germany, and United States; he blended kitsch with references to Giotto, van Gogh, Picasso, and Duchamp. His focus was towards historical themes in terms of spatial and temporal shifts was addressed to several Venezuelan artist one of them being Carlos Zerpa. The preoccupation with time seems especially relevant in a country whose historical development does not go back much before the eighteenth century. Carlos Zerpa and Miguel von Dangel chose as their referent the period of the discovery of the new world and just prior, through a mythology of its human and animal inhabitants primarily located in the Caribbean and the area now occupied by Venezuela. Zerpa after Christopher Columbus encountering “new tribes, strange animals and lush forests” Carlos capitalized these myths as well as on his grasp of Western art history, from which he appropriated liberally.\n\nInfluence:\nCarlos Zerpa series the” India Nova's” El Dorado was greatly influenced by Theodor de Bry, a Flemish designer, engraver, and printmaker. Zerpa valued de Bry's work that his most recognized series was his interpretation on acrylic painting series called “El Dorado” which was based on the fanciful chronicles and records of European explorers and visually on prints by the Belgium artist.  Zerpa deliberately created a secondhand visual account of an already distorted Eurocentric one by borrowing from de Bry; he perpetuated the farce by enhancing/ modifying a modern-day mythology for the new world.  Zerpa did his own version of “El Dorado” the de Bry's 1594 print of an Indian ruler being dusted with gold before a ritual ceremony. In Zerpa's garishly colored painting, the Indian ruler stands in a classical contrapposto while the attendants sponge him with paint and blow the gold powder onto his naked body. A dark eagle hovers menacingly above. Zerpa reversed the figures to account for the fact that the source was a printed image. The eagle in his painting substitutes for a mountain in de Bry's print. Zerpa managed to incorporate personal genuine totaling, for example by reversing the figures seeing as it was a printed image it was easily manipulated, he also replaced the mountain on de Bry's print with an eagle. There is major diversity on both de Bry's piece with Zerpa depiction of “El Dorado”, but both equally respond individual. Zerpa's transformation of “El Dorado”(1987;PL. 12.8), “The Golden One” was a very stylistic approach with vibrant neon colors lavishing from the ground up. The totality of the golden one deems modern, pop art capturing historical events from time in an original method.\nAnother work by Zerpa “Acefalo A cephalous, or (The Headless one 1987), he parodies accounts of a headless tribe with an arrow-bearing figure whose face is on his chest. In one of his typical anachronisms, Zerpa includes a barely detectable chair in the sky above the figure, appropriated from van Gogh's painting of his bedroom in Arles.\nOther works by the Carlos Zerpa series are, [El Dorado], [The Golden One] in the Nova series of 1987, acrylic on canvas 192x132 cm which exhibited at Caracas, Mercantil Collection. Other paintings Zerpa interprets [Acephalous, or The Headless One](1987), [This Golden Whale] (1987), [Trito, an Adam in the Tropics] (1986).

Family folklore, backyard rituals, religious sacraments, ghost stories, church, school, obedience and trust in what you're told are among my subjects. The things we're taught can be learned a thousand different ways. I like for the familiar to seem a little unfamiliar and complicated, because it is.\nI look at images from the past as I work because they're heartbreaking and so haunting – what was never can be again. I mess with my imagery, layering and wearing it away until I've made a painting that makes you notice the paint as much as the pictures.\"Grill's recent works are abstract, drawing inspiration from early American sampler embroidery. After studying artists Peter Doig and Mamma Andersson, Grill began to rely her source material for a mood, rather than a literal imagery or narrative.Grill's 2015 Touch’d Lustre was her fifth solo show in New York, and her first show at the gallery Zieher Smith & Horton. The show included eight large, abstract, oil-on-linen paintings. Further departing from her figurative beginnings, the paintings' imagery referred to modernist abstraction. The show attracted critical attention from publications including The New York Times, The Brooklyn Rail, and Hyperallergic.

She worked for a time as a nanny and domestic. It was during her employment in Namibia that she was first exposed to textile art, when an employer taught her to do needlework and embroidery. In 1990 she joined the Kuru Art Project as a translator; exposure to different art forms encouraged her to try her hand at creating artwork herself, although she had no formal training.

In January 2000 her work was shown in Gaborone alongside that of Ann Gollifer and Neo Matome. During her career Qgam showed work through Southern Africa as well as in Europe, Japan, and the United States.

Although Stokes painted few works in the 1930s, her paintings and drawings were exhibited from the 1940s onwards. She was one of only two women, and two Victorians, included in a major exhibition of twelve Australian artists that travelled to Canada, the United Kingdom and Italy in the early 1950s.\nInfluenced by George Bell, Stokes was part of the Melbourne Contemporary Artists, a group Bell established in 1940. Her works continued to be well-regarded for many years after the group's formation, in contrast to those by many of her Victorian modernist colleagues, with favourable reviews from critics such as Sir Philip Hendy in the United Kingdom and Bernard William Smith in Australia.\nHer husband's early death in 1962 forced Stokes to return to painting as a career, resulting in a successful one-woman show in 1964, her first in thirty years. She continued to paint and exhibit through the 1970s and 1980s, and was the subject of a retrospective exhibition that toured Victorian regional galleries including Swan Hill Regional Art Gallery and Geelong Art Gallery in 1985.

Without abandoning his realist style of painting, during the 1920s, he developed a more solid and synthetic rendering of form, influenced by the contemporary researches of the Novecento Italiano group, which he joined after the first Milan exhibition in 1926.After his debut in the Esposizione Nazionale d’Arte, held at the Palazzo della Permanente in Milan in 1927, he began to exhibit regularly from 1928 onwards in the Venice Biennale and all the principal, official exhibitions in Italy and abroad. He gained extensive recognition through his vast repertoire of portraits, female figures and still lifes as well as his notable production of landscapes, in which he combines the severe language of the 20th century with studies from life. After being appointed director of the Carrara Academy in Bergamo in 1931, he played a pivotal role in the cultural renewal of the city and he executed a mural for the Casa Littoria \"A.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-08234", "doctext": "Domenico di Michelino (1417–1491) was an Italian Renaissance painter who was born and died in Florence. His real name was Domenico di Francesco. The patronymic \"di Michelino\" was adopted in honor of his teacher, the cassone painter Michelino di Benedetto (c. 1378-1499), by whom no works have been identified. Giorgio Vasari reports that Domenico was also a pupil of Fra Angelico, whose influence is reflected in many of Domenico's paintings along with that of Filippo Lippi and Pesellino.\nDomenico enrolled in the Florentine painters' confraternity, the Compagnia di San Luca, by 1442. Two years later he joined the Arte dei Medici e Speziali, the Florentine painters' guild. He had a workshop in the Via delle Terme, Florence, which he shared with Domenico di Zanobi (formerly known as the Master of the Johnson Nativity).His earliest extant work is a processional banner for the Ospedale degli Innocenti, Florence, in which the Virgin is shown protecting the martyred innocents beneath her mantle. Commissioned in 1440 and completed in 1446, the picture was entirely repainted in the sixteenth century by Michele Tosini.In 1449-50 Domenico painted the chapel of Saint Leonard in the church of Santa Maria a Peretola in the outskirts of Florence. The chapel includes a lunette with a scene of Saint Leonard Freeing Prisoners as well as images of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, Saint Lucy and musical angels.In 1458 Domenico painted an altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with Saints, now at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, and in 1463 he was commissioned an altarpiece by Cosimo de' Medici for the church of San Girolamo in Volterra (now at Volterra's Museo Diocesano). Other, undated altarpieces are in Anghiari (Santo Stefano), Dijon (Musée des Beaux-Arts), Florence (Galleria dell'Accademia), San Gimignano (Museo Civico) and San Giovanni Valdarno (Museo della Basilica di Santa Maria delle Grazie). A painting of Saint Lawrence at San Lorenzo a Porciano in Stia, painted between 1477 and 1482, is representative of Domenico's late work. In addition to altarpieces, he also made many small-scale paintings of religious subjects, painted the fronts of cassoni, and illuminated manuscripts. \nDomenico's most famous work is the Comedy Illuminating Florence on the north wall of the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, Florence. According to documents, the painting was commissioned on 30 January 1465 and was designed by Alesso Baldovinetti. It shows Dante Alighieri presenting his famous poem, the Divine Comedy, to the city of Florence. Views of Hell, Mount Purgatory and Paradise appear in the background, all as described in the poem. It has been suggested that the painting was inspired by Giovanni di Paolo's illumination for Paradiso 17 in the Yates Thompson Manuscript (c. 1444-1450; London, British Library), one of the finest Divine Comedy manuscripts ever produced, which shows all of the same details but in reverse.Domenico was still active in 1483 but few of his works from this period survive. He died in Florence on 18 April 1491 and was buried in the church of Sant'Ambrogio.The art historian Bernard Berenson mistakenly assigned all of Domenico's paintings to Giusto d'Andrea (1440-1496), and misattributed Zanobi Strozzi's paintings to Domenico di Michelino.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1417", 23]]], "death": [[["1491", 28]]], "nationality": [[["Italian", 41]]], "painter_name": [[["Domenico di Michelino", 0]]]}}

Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic. Friend and spiritual heir to Théodore Géricault, Delacroix was also inspired by Lord Byron, with whom he shared a strong identification with the \"forces of the sublime\", of nature in often violent action.However, Delacroix was given to neither sentimentality nor bombast, and his Romanticism was that of an individualist. In the words of Baudelaire, \"Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible.\" Together with Ingres, Delacroix is considered one of the last old Masters of painting, and one of the few who was ever photographed.\nAs a painter and muralist, Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-11449", "doctext": "Francisco de Palacios, also Francisco Palacios, (1623-January 1652), was a Spanish Baroque painter.\nDe Palacios was initially known through only two small still lifes, acquired in Madrid in late seventeenth century by Count Ferdinand Harrach Buenaventura, published by August L. Mayer in 1922, and two paintings of San Onofre and San Francisco de Asis in the convent Calatravas Moralzarzal (Madrid). When the paintings were first seen, Buenaventura saw the influence of Antonio Ponz, and thought maybe the author was El Greco, so he was surprised when he recognized the signing of Palacios. Palacios was therefore primarily understood to be a still life painter until later research revealed he had done portraits and landscapes as well.\nIn January 1646 he married Josefa Berges, daughter of painter and paint merchant Francisco Berges, stating in the contract they were both older than twenty. The couple had two children, and in December 1651, being seriously ill, gave testament, ordering six hundred Masses with other demands, including one for the canonization of St. Maria de la Cabeza, indicating a good financial standard of living. He died in Madrid in January 1652, having fixed his residence on the street of Alcala. Both in the will as at the auction of the estate of his father, who died in 1672, there are interesting news about the paintings of various palaces, covering all genres. Along with some unspecified paintings for Nicholas Jacobs, are cited in the will a portrait of Doña Teresa, wife of Joseph Ferriol official of the secretariat of the Indies, and landscape in any number you did to Juan Pastrana, of those still was owed certain amounts. In addition, to Jerome Gonzalez Bricianos, cashier Manuel Lopez de Salcedo made a large picture of the Virgin and St. Joseph and the Infant Jesus and Eternal Glory to the Father. Also cited by Palacios were three \"Orchard stained by natural\", another still life of \"a table with some peaches and olives and clay\" , and \"a landscape and a Crowning with thorns\".\n\nThe relationship with Diego Velázquez who he is believed to have been a disciple could be indirectly confirmed by a curious clause in the will by which he said he had given \"Don Diego de Silva a garnish of sword and dagger which is what this update brings\". Based on style characteristics, Palacios has recently attributed the famous painting of The Knight's Dream, traditionally assigned to Antonio de Pereda. Lately Azanza Javier Lopez, an art historian for the University of Navarra, greatly expanded the number of known works of the painter. The delicate treatment of the hands, so different from that usually found in the work of Pereda, could be also another argument in favor of the new painting attribution.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1623", 49]]], "death": [[["1652", 62]]], "nationality": [[["Spanish", 75]]], "painter_name": [[["Francisco de Palacios", 0]]]}}

As an artist, he was active in Shanghai. In painting his works mainly concerned plants, beauty, and figures. However he also did numerous landscapes. In poetry he preferred the rhyming ci form and added such poems to his paintings.\nHis social circle included prominent literati as well as artists. He organized both a literary society and a Buddhist lay society.  His work often used a delicate baimiao (outline) style, which can be clearly see in his illustrations for Dream of the Red Chamber. The illustrations are chiefly portraits of the main characters in the novel. Numerous poets, including the renowned woman poet Zhou Qi, wrote poems to accompany the illustrations.The scholar Wang Qisun 王岂孙 commissioned Gai Qi to paint an album of famous Chinese women, both historical and legendary. Wang's second wife, Cao Zhenxiu wrote poems about the women and did the calligraphy in the album.\nGai took as a student the talented woman painter and poet Qian Shoupu 錢守璞 (ca. 1801-1869).\nHe was associated with the painter Fei Danxu in what has been called the \"Gai Fei\" school.  Gai's grandson continued the tradition of the Gai Fei school, along with descendants of Fei Danxiu. He is perhaps best known today for the Hongloumeng tiyong, a book of portraits of characters in Dream of the Red Chamber accompanied by poems about the characters. The book was based on paintings done by Gai Qi, but was not published until 1884, long after its death. The book is still in print.\nGai Qi's work is held in the permanent collections of many museums worldwide, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Johnson Museum of Art, the Palace Museum, the British Museum, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Princeton University Art Museum, and the Indianapolis Museum of Art.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1774", 21]]], "death": [[["1829", 26]]], "nationality": [[["Chinese", 8]]], "painter_name": [[["Gai Qi", 0]]]}}

Born in London, Holt was active artistically from 1965–1998, first at Notting Hill and later living and working in Devon until his death.\nHolt started his professional career in Bayswater selling to tourists from the railings at Hyde Park. Thus his work spread worldwide; an example is the hand colored print \"The Hunter\", discovered and restored in New Zealand.\nHis talent was spotted at 13 with an entry into Camberwell School of Art. He left at 18.\nHolt started  selling his paintings  around the early 1960s on Bayswater Road. Many minor drawings and large oil paintings were produced, resulting in small exhibitions. He then spent some years at the Portobello market with hand crafted chess set reproductions. At the same time  the Afro-Caribbean music scene developed and Holt designed some Bob Marley covers produced from his paintings. Denis Holt, Geoff Holt's younger brother, assisted with his work until 1980.\nDuring an independent writing project, which involved identifying a number of important video artists from the mid-1980s, film enthusiast Kevin Hall uncovered no less than nine examples of Geoff's work. It is confirmed that these works were commissioned in late 1986 by video software distributor, \"Motion Pictures On Video\" for use on this parent label and its offshoots, Quick Video and Screen In Doors. During this period of 'research', Kevin described Geoff's painted works as: \"playing a hugely important role in creating a mood that helped define this unique period in the UK's video history,\" continuing so suggest that \"Geoff helped bridge the gap between the classic and the modern with many of his uniquely colourful sleeve designs.\"\nThere is little doubt that Geoff had a keen eye for 'stylish' figurative painting; likewise the artist's decidedly brief diversification into designing a number of illustrations which were used as video artworks is seen today as something of a milestone in modern pop culture.

He was educated at St Peter's College, Auckland and at the University of Auckland from which he graduated Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Elam School of Fine Arts in 1977. He has had 27 major solo exhibitions in New Zealand and Australia, commencing in 1978.\nBaloghy's style can be called a particular kind of realism, where major elements are altered and shifted around for dramatic effect. Some of these paintings are close to fiction, yet attempt to narrate a greater truth of the feeling of place. The realism depicted has been described by John Daly-Peoples as being more like paintings of models of the landscape. Heightened edges and colours produce a sharpness of detail and an atmosphere that is at once familiar, yet faintly alien. Many of his works contain references to other painters and paintings.\nBaloghy lives and works in Auckland and Hahei Beach on the Coromandel Peninsula. Many of the subjects of his paintings are in those places. In 2007 he completed a major series of paintings of Wellington subjects.\n\nBaloghy then focused on iconic pieces of New Zealand art, producing parodic interpretations of signature New Zealand regional paintings such as Robin White's Mangaweka and Christopher Perkin's 1931 painting Taranaki. In painting these works Baloghy has intimately studied the painting techniques of several important New Zealand artists such as Colin McCahon, Don Binney, Rita Angus and Bill Hammond and replicated it with himself (and his car) located in their works. Some of the artists parodied have themselves been students of Baloghy.In a return to his Auckland roots, Baloghy's most recent works have chronicled areas of Auckland City over the past one hundred years, highlighting the minutest of details, from the spectacular to the mundane, and often placing anachronistic classical buildings, objects or scenes or copies of other artists' paintings in the Auckland locations.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1950", 30]]], "death": [], "nationality": [[["New Zealand", 51]]], "painter_name": [[["George Baloghy", 0]]]}}

Born as a son of local bailiff Eliseus de Hoog (also de Hooch) and Josina van Platen, who married in 1629 in The Hague. Gerrit's wife, Anna van Eyck (born The Hague 1629, married 1660 The Hague), is recorded widow in 1680. Anna's father was Hermanus van Eyck, who had the great philosopher Daniel Heinsius as an uncle and tutor. Gerrit himself is related to the portrait painter Dirck Cornelis de Hooch, who was his father's brother. Gerrit's son Eliseus de Hooch was a painter, too (Mr Constrijkschilder) and an engraver in silver. Eliseus worked and lived in The Hague and Rotterdam. Gerrit's daughter Josyanna Maria de Hooch married the painter Frederick Bernaerts, who lived and worked in The Hague.\nIt is likely that Gerrit is related to the engraver Cornelis de Hooghe, who claimed to be one of Emperor Charles V's bastard sons and was executed for conspiracy in 1583.\nOne or two works by Gerrit the Hooch are known today, but their attribution is dubious.\nRelation to the famous painter Pieter de Hooch or to the engraver Romeyn de Hooghe are highly unlikely.\nGerrit de Hooch was a friend of the painters Caspar Netscher and Melchior d'Hondecoeter. The first one attended the baptism of a daughter Margaretha in 1676, named after Caspar's wife Margaretha Godijn. The latter signed Gerrit's last will.\nGerrit rented a house that was owned by the painter Nicolaas Willingh and he testified against the painter Pieter Plantijn, who had left his Irish wife.

He was a pupil of Jing Hao, and known as a critical figure in the development of the era's monumental landscape painting. His landscape paintings achieved a believable and compelling portrayal of the natural world, an achievement typifying the tenth-century artists drive in the portrayal of nature.  The great popularity Guan's distinctive style achieved is one measure of the popularity of landscape painting at the time.Autumn Mountain Shadow is one of the paintings attributed to Guan Tong, and although there are several works attributed to him, there are no extant works bearing his signature. In this picture a barely visible steep path climbs through the rugged mountains. The work appears to be the visual equivalent of the poems describing hard journeys such as Li Bai's The Road to Shu is Hard (Shudao nan). Guan's works focus also on the representation of the cyclical seasons of nature: a concept central to Chinese medicine and many schools of Chinese philosophy.\n\nGuan Tong favored the use of 'axe chopped' brushstrokes, Fu Pi Cun, to depict the angular rocky forms of the northern mountains. His strong peaks and densely compacted composition represents the northern tradition in its most likely form as scholars understand it today. Scholars describe Guan's works, along with certain pieces by his teacher Jing Hao, as advanced and impressive pieces for their era, and not works that should be counted as inferior or preliminary to the mature landscape art of the Song.Twentieth-century artist Chang Dai-chien forged a painting which was successfully passed off as an original by Guan Tong; the painting was purchased by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1957 and was assumed, at the time, to be a work by Guan Tong.

Glanmore has an artifact collection known as the Couldery Collection.  Horatio H. Couldery's brother and sister-in-law Bertram and Cecilia Couldery travelled to Belleville in the 1880s and kept a second home there.  Their collection of fine art, decorative objects and furniture was given to the City of Belleville in the 1950s and is housed at Glanmore National Historic Site.

Couldery painted with a sense of humour, often portraying animals in mischievous situations that successfully captured the character and personality of beloved pets. He was noted for his skillful depiction of the texture of animal fur in minute detail. His work, with its great attention to detail, was highly regarded by art critic John Ruskin.  Ruskin reviewed a cat painting exhibited in 1875 and said it was \"“…quite the most skillful piece of minutiae and Dureresque painting in the exhibition – (it cannot rightly be seen without a lens): and in its sympathy with kitty nature…unsurpassable.”Couldery's first wife Rachel Elizabeth died a few years after their marriage.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-17161", "doctext": "Joseph Mallord William Turner  (23 April 1775 – 19 December 1851), known in his time as William Turner, was an English Romantic painter, printmaker and watercolourist. He is known for his expressive colourisations, imaginative landscapes and turbulent, often violent marine paintings. He left behind more than 550 oil paintings, 2,000 watercolours, and 30,000 works on paper. He was championed by the leading English art critic John Ruskin from 1840, and is today regarded as having elevated landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting.Turner was born in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, London, to a modest lower-middle-class family. He lived in London all his life, retaining his Cockney accent and assiduously avoiding the trappings of success and fame. A child prodigy, Turner studied at the Royal Academy of Arts from 1789, enrolling when he was 14, and exhibited his first work there at 15. During this period, he also served as an architectural draftsman. He earned a steady income from commissions and sales, which due to his troubled, contrary nature, were often begrudgingly accepted. He opened his own gallery in 1804 and became professor of perspective at the academy in 1807, where he lectured until 1828, although he was viewed as profoundly inarticulate. He travelled to Europe from 1802, typically returning with voluminous sketchbooks.\nIntensely private, eccentric and reclusive, Turner was a controversial figure throughout his career. He did not marry, but fathered two daughters, Eveline (1801–1874) and Georgiana (1811–1843), by his housekeeper Sarah Danby. He became more pessimistic and morose as he got older, especially after the death of his father, after which his outlook deteriorated, his gallery fell into disrepair and neglect, and his art intensified. In 1841 Turner rowed a boat into the Thames so he could not be counted as present at any property in that year's census. He lived in squalor and poor health from 1845, and died in London in 1851 aged 76.

Part of Nointel's commission was to purchase manuscripts, medallions and sculptures while abroad. Carrey was recommended by his master, Charles Le Brun, to be included in the entourage as draughtsman. As a result of this, between 1670 and 1679 Carrey executed over 500 drawings of towns, antiquities, ceremonies and examples of local fetes and customs in Asia Minor, Greece and Palestine.  He also painted in oil; one surviving canvas of Athens in 1674 shows his skill.Nointel’s group visited Athens in November 1674. Here in a two-week period Carrey produced about fifty-five drawings of the sculptures on the Parthenon. Thirty-five of these, showing details of the pediments, metopes and frieze, now survive in the Paris Bibliotheque Nationale. Since 20% of the Parthenon’s sculpture was destroyed in the Venetian bombardment of 1687, Carrey's work is the sole record of much of this missing section, though not all since some of the sculpture was irretrievably lost. His red and black chalk drawings, probably taken from life, meticulously record the cracks and other damage, making no attempt to complete missing details.\nOn returning to Paris in 1679 Carrey presented Le Brun with the drawings he had made in Constantinople; several are in the Cabinet des Dessins at the Louvre, Paris. Three paintings known to have been made by Carrey in 1675 are presently unknown, but the painting depicting The Marquis de Nointel before the City of Athens in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Chartres is almost certainly his.

Ingres was profoundly influenced by past artistic traditions and aspired to become the guardian of academic orthodoxy against the ascendant Romantic style. Although he considered himself a painter of history in the tradition of Nicolas Poussin and Jacques-Louis David, it is his portraits, both painted and drawn, that are recognized as his greatest legacy. His expressive distortions of form and space made him an important precursor of modern art, influencing Picasso, Matisse and other modernists.\nBorn into a modest family in Montauban, he travelled to Paris to study in the studio of David. In 1802 he made his Salon debut, and won the Prix de Rome for his painting The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles. By the time he departed in 1806 for his residency in Rome, his style—revealing his close study of Italian and Flemish Renaissance masters—was fully developed, and would change little for the rest of his life. While working in Rome and subsequently Florence from 1806 to 1824, he regularly sent paintings to the Paris Salon, where they were faulted by critics who found his style bizarre and archaic. He received few commissions during this period for the history paintings he aspired to paint, but was able to support himself and his wife as a portrait painter and draughtsman.\nHe was finally recognized at the Salon in 1824, when his Raphaelesque painting, The Vow of Louis XIII, was met with acclaim, and Ingres was \nacknowledged as the leader of the Neoclassical school in France. Although the income from commissions for history paintings allowed him to paint fewer portraits, his Portrait of Monsieur Bertin marked his next popular success in 1833. The following year, his indignation at the harsh criticism of his ambitious composition The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian caused him to return to Italy, where he assumed directorship of the French Academy in Rome in 1835. He returned to Paris for good in 1841.

He was called a \"remarkable and imaginative painter\" by the critic and historian Christopher Wood in Victorian Painting (1999).Grimshaw’s love for realism stemmed from a passion for photography, which would eventually lend itself to the creative process.

This technique, allegedly used by Caravaggio, as well as Vermeer, was condemned by a number of his contemporaries who believed it demonstrated less skill than painting by eye, with some claiming that his paintings appeared to \"show no marks of handling or brushwork\", while others \"were doubtful whether they could be accepted as paintings at all\". However, many recognised his mastery of colour, lighting and shadow, as well as his unique ability to provoke strong emotional responses in the viewer. James McNeill Whistler, who Grimshaw worked with in his Chelsea studios, stated, “I considered myself the inventor of nocturnes until I saw Grimmy’s moonlit pictures.” His early paintings were signed \"JAG\", \"J.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-19796", "doctext": "John Durand (active 1765–1782) was a colonial American portraitist. With John Mare, Abraham Delanoy, and Lawrence Kilburn, he was one of a number of portraitists living and working in New York City during the 1760s.\nNothing is known of Durand's origins, training or upbringing, as is often the case with colonial American painters. As he is referred to in two different known sources as \"monsieur Duran\" it has been assumed that he was of French descent. This assumption has been bolstered by the rococo colors used in his paintings, which some sources have taken to suggest that if not born in France he was at least trained there. It appears more likely, however, that he is the same \"John Durand\" that was apprenticed to Charles Catton in London on September 15, 1760, for a seven-year term. Just when Durand emigrated is unknown; he is first recorded in Virginia in 1765, but by 1766 was in New York City, where an entry in the account book of James Beekman records payment to the artist for portraits of the six Beekman children. In 1767 he advertised the opening of a drawing school in New York, on Broad Street. New York remained his base of operations for some years, although signatures on a number of portraits indicate that he returned to Virginia in 1769, 1771, 1775, and 1780. According to his nephew, Robert Sully, he was prolific there; Sully wrote of him that \"He painted an immense number of portraits in Virginia; his works are hard and dry, but appear to have been strong likenesses, with less vulgarity of style than artists of his calibre generally possess.\"  He is known to have traveled to Connecticut twice for work; a 1768 advertisement from the Connecticut Journal survives, and suggests that he planned on a sojourn of at least a few months in the colony. A trip to Bermuda is also known. By 1770 he was in Virginia, working in Williamsburg and later in Petersburg. Durand drops out of sight as an artist after 1775, when he signed and dated a pair of portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Gray Briggs of Dinwiddie County, Virginia. It has been suggested that he remained in Virginia, as the only other references to him after that point are a painting from Virginia dated 1781 and an entry in the Dinwiddie County tax rolls of 1782. It has also been claimed that he was working in Chesterfield County in 1780. One source claims that he returned to England after this point, an assertion which does not appear to be supported anywhere else.Durand has been described as the \"most consistently delightful\" of the painters working in New York during the 1760s. His approach to painting was linear and decorative, and suggests training as a decorative painter. Like many other painters of the era he saw no need to restrict himself to representational painting; a 1770 advertisement from The Virginia Gazette reveals that he would \"paint, gild, and varnish wheel carriages; and put coats of arms, or ciphers upon them.\" While living in New York he described himself as a history painter, but no history paintings by his hand are known. Little is known of his artistic influences, but some scholars have seen in his later work indication that he was familiar with the paintings of John Singleton Copley, as he began more sophisticated attempts at modeling his figures in the mid-1770s. Certain stylistic peculiarities distinguish Durand's work from that of other painters; these include a peculiar splayed display of fingers, in which one or two are lifted and separated from the rest. His female sitters hold a single flower in one hand, frequently near the bosom, and sometimes the flowers are turned on their stems to reveal a star-shaped array of leaves.Durand's earliest surviving works date to his time in New York; they are so assured as to indicate that he had already had ample practice as a portraitist, but no earlier paintings are known to exist. Besides the Beekman family he was known to other prominent families in New York, including the Rays and the Rapaljes; his group portrait of The Rapalje Children, dating to around 1768 and currently in the collection of the New-York Historical Society, is widely adjudged his most successful work. Other surviving portraits include a pendant pair in the National Gallery of Art, a portrait in the Museum of the City of New York, and two unconnected works in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A pair of portraits attributed to Durand were sold by Sotheby's in 2014 for $389,000.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==", "extracts": {"birth": [], "death": [], "nationality": [[["American", 46]]], "painter_name": [[["John Durand", 0]]]}}

Jose Caraballo exhibited paintings in 1950 in Chicago. He then exhibited at the Oller-Campeche-Gallery in Puerto Rico, Galleria II, Galleria Tito, Allen Rich Galleries, Duncan Galleries in Paris, France, and many other Galleries throughout New York. Jose Caraballo also had exhibits at the Museum of the City of New York, Livingston College, Howard University in Washington, Cornell Medical Center, Mount Sinai Hospital, and El Museo del Barrio in NYC. Jose Caraballo has had extensive television coverage of his paintings and other works of art.\nIn 1979, while President of the Hispanic Arte League (H.A.L), Jose Caraballo organized the 1st Latin American Art Biennial in NYC.

Rufino Tamayo helped inspire the works in stencil that Jose Caraballo would create after that visit. Jose Caraballo was one of the first artists to depict the life and culture of the Taino Indians of Borinquen. Caraballo also explored other aspects of Puerto Rican culture and artistic horizons, through his paintings, drawings, graphics, and tapestries.

When he had thoroughly explored Borinquen's pre-history in his art, he continued with other aspects of Puerto Rican culture and history but also creates surrealist and semi-abstract work which is always ingenious and fascinating. In his paintings and drawings on Puerto Rican themes he cultivates a stylized realism. His horizons are wide; and he is one of the truly eminent Puerto Rican artists\".
