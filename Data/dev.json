In some ways, Allori is the last of the line of prominent Florentine painters, of generally undiluted Tuscan artistic heritage: Andrea del Sarto worked with Fra Bartolomeo (as well as Leonardo da Vinci), Pontormo briefly worked under Andrea, and trained Bronzino, who trained Allori. Subsequent generations in the city would be strongly influenced by the tide of Baroque styles pre-eminent in other parts of Italy.\nFreedberg derides Allori as derivative, claiming  he illustrates \"the ideal of Maniera by which art (and style) are generated out of pre-existing art.\" The polish of figures has an unnatural marble-like form as if he aimed for cold statuary. It can be said of late phase mannerist painting in Florence, that the city that had early breathed life into statuary with the works of masters like Donatello and Michelangelo, was still so awed by them that it petrified the poses of figures in painting. While by 1600 the Baroque elsewhere was beginning to give life to painted figures, Florence was painting two-dimensional statues. Furthermore, in general, with the exception of the Counter-Maniera (Counter-Mannerism) artists, it dared not stray from high themes or stray into high emotion.\nAmong his collaborators was Giovanni Maria Butteri and his main pupil was Giovanni Bizzelli. Cristoforo del Altissimo,  Cesare Dandini, Aurelio Lomi, John Mosnier, Alessandro Pieroni, Giovanni Battista Vanni, and Monanni also were his pupils. Allori was one of the artists, working under Vasari, included in the decoration of the Studiolo of Francesco I.\nHe was the father of the painter Cristofano Allori (1577–1621).", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Alessandro Allori", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1535", 74]]], "3_death": [[["1607", 94]]], "4_nationality": [[["Italian", 107]]]}}

She entered Cornell University as an English major and later transferred to Oberlin College, where she received her BA in studio art in 1962. While at Oberlin, she studied art history with Wolfgang Stechow. From 1970 to 2005, she lived and worked in New York City. Dalton Brown currently lives in the Hudson Valley and in King Ferry, New York.\nWhile living in rural upstate New York and after moving to New York City, Dalton Brown painted and drew barns from 1965 to 1977. A 2006 review of her solo retrospective of works on paper described these as offering \"a moving, somewhat cinematic perspective on the power and vagaries of memory.\" Becoming increasingly abstract, the barn imagery evolved into paintings like Shadow of Tree and Table, .Dalton Brown is most interested in the evocative qualities of a subject and its personal associations as seen in the paintings Grand Westfield Porch and My Westfield Window (1980), and the pastels Retreat Grasses and Aurora, Six Columns. Expressing mood, attitude, and ideas are key to understanding the meaning of her work: \"The visual tension between controlled, linear, constructed elements and textured, disordered, active areas has always intrigued me. I still like to compose my images with these contrasts which I think have symbolic implications as well as visual interest and compositional strength.\"\nAmong her best known works are paintings and pastels of light and water often executed on a very large scale, such as Horizon, (1980). Dalton Brown's ability to capture light playing across a wall, on the surface of water, or passing through translucent drapery is a signature motif and visible in Quiet Breathing,. Her \"eye for the supernal in the everyday\" is displayed in Whisper and Blues Come Through. Framing devices are removed and location becomes ambiguous in paintings such as Long Golden Day and Easy Blues. These themes continue to interest the artist as seen in the pastel Interlude.Recent paintings and pastels depict themes inspired by Dalton Brown's 2015 Visiting Artist Residency at the American Academy in Rome.

A shift away from his academic style took place in the late 1880s under the influence of several acquaintances associated with Post-Impressionism and Symbolism. Osbert abandoned naturalistic painting in favour of a Pointillist technique like that employed by Seurat and Signac. Also inspired by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and the Symbolists, he chose to forsake depiction of real-world subject matter, and developed a poetic visual language of his own. His signature style consists of ghostlike Muses in mysterious landscapes bathed in the unearthly light of a sun or moon, rendered with abundant use of the colour blue. In the 1890s he was associated with Joséphin Péladan and his order of Rosicrucianism.\nOsbert's later works include a few commissioned murals, for sites including the Centre Thermal des Dômes in Vichy (1903 and 1904), and the Church Of Saint-Louis in Vichy (1915).

When you look at wood grain, sometimes -- and you can almost feel the sense of something alive, of course it was once alive, but that imprint; the foot-print of it is still there. When I paint right on the wood it influences the colors I use. It reminds me to keep things really natural.\nSol's works are characterized by young maidens in dream-like nature settings with oversized or sometimes fanciful creatures.

He began studying drawing at the age of thirteen, and he exhibited regularly in Lisbon, Bilbao, Barcelona, and Madrid in his twenties and thirties, winning many prizes, including the Gold Medal painting prize in Barcelona's La Punyalada competition in 1965.At the beginning of the 1960s, he was a close friend of the French painter Maurice Boitel, who painted many pictures on the Pitxot family's property in Cadaqués, a small port town on the Mediterranean Sea near the French border, that was also painted by Pablo Picasso and André Derain.In 1966, Pitxot took up permanent residence in Cadaqués, where his family had owned a summer house since the end of the 19th century. He began to experiment with surrealism: in particular, he became focused on anthropomorphic figures composed of the stones that lined the seashores near his home. Pitxot worked in a unique way: he would build sculptures from stones, and then paint those sculptures in oil.\nMuch of Pixtot's work is concerned with allegory and myth, including the figure of Mnemosyne, the mother of the nine muses who personified memory, and a series of works about The Tempest.\nPitxot's association with Salvador Dalí began before his birth, because their families were acquainted. But Dalí became an early supporter of Antonio Pitxot's work, and eventually asked him to co-design the Dalí Theatre and Museum (Teatre-Museu Dalí) in Figueres, Spain. There is also a permanent exhibition of Pitxot's work on one floor of that museum.\nPitxot and Dalí were nearly inseparable in the last years of Dalí's life: designing Dalí's museum, teaching art and exchanging ideas about their work. Pitxot was a protector of Dalí's legacy after his death: He was a member of the board of the Gala Salvador Dalí Foundation, and he has led, and sat on the board, of several other Dalí foundations.\nHe became the museum's director after Dalí's death.\nPitxot was a respected international Catalan artist in his own right. In the year 2000, he was appointed corresponding academician for Cadaqués of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Saint George.  In the 2004, he received the Gold Medal of Merit in Fine Arts from the King of Spain as a recognition for his work.

He studied painting at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago during the 1910s, graduating in 1918. Motley is most famous for his colorful chronicling of the African-American experience during the 1920s and 1930s, and is considered one of the major contributors to the Harlem Renaissance, or the New Negro Movement, a time in which African-American art reached new heights not just in New York but across America—its local expression is referred to as the Chicago Black Renaissance.\nThe Renaissance marked a period of a flourishing and renewed black psyche. There was a newfound appreciation of black artistic and aesthetic culture. Consequently, many black artists felt a moral obligation to create works that would perpetuate a positive representation of black people. During this time, Alain Locke coined the idea of the \"New Negro\", which was focused on creating progressive and uplifting images of blacks within society.

Furse, archdeacon of Westminster, and rector of St John's, Smith Square and descended collaterally from Sir Joshua Reynolds; and in his short span of life demonstrated such skill as a portrait and figure painter that he forms an important link in the chain of British portraiture which extends from the time when Van Dyck was called to the court of Charles I into the 20th century.\nHis talent was precocious; at the age of seven he gave indications of it in a number of drawings illustrating the novels of Sir Walter Scott. He attended public school at Haileybury College. He entered the Slade School in 1884, winning the Slade scholarship in the following year, and completed his education at Julian's atelier in Paris. Hard worker as he was, his activity was frequently interrupted by spells of illness, for he had developed signs of consumption whilst still attending the Slade School. An important canvas called Cain was his first contribution (1888) to the Royal Academy, to the associateship of which he was elected in the year of his death. For some years before he had been a staunch supporter of the New English Art Club, to the exhibitions of which he was a regular contributor.\nIn October 1900 he married Katharine Symonds, the daughter of John Addington Symonds. She later became known as Dame Katharine Furse. The couple had two sons. His fondness for sport and of an open-air life found expression in his art and introduced a new, fresh and vigorous note into portraiture. There is never a suggestion of the studio or of the fatiguing pose in his portraits. The sitters appear unconscious of being painted, and are generally seen in the pursuit of their favourite outdoor sport or pastime, in the full enjoyment of life. Such are the Diana of the Uplands, the Lord Roberts and The Return from the Ride at the Tate Gallery; the four children in the Cubbing with the York and Ainsty, The Lilac Gown, Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Fishing and the portraits of Lord Charles Beresford and William Johnson Cory. His revealing portrait of a younger Charles Darling who as Mr Justice Darling was later to sit on the criminal appeal of Sir Roger Casement is in the National Portrait Gallery.\nNearly all of Furse's work shows a pronounced decorative tendency. His sense of space, composition and decorative design can best be judged by his mural decorations for Liverpool Town Hall, executed between 1899 and 1902. A memorial exhibition of Furse's paintings and sketches was held at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1906.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Charles Wellington Furse", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1868", 38]]], "3_death": [[["1904", 56]]], "4_nationality": [[["British", 395]]]}}

When decimal currency was introduced in South Africa, she was asked to design the floral motifs for the 10, 20 and 50 cent coins. Besides painting she was an accomplished poet and published \"Children of the Hours\" when she was in her eighties.\nCythna was the eldest child of her mother Josina Christina Lindenberg's second marriage and was named after the heroine in Percy Shelley's poem \"The Revolt of Islam\". The Lettys had five children and for many years the six children from Josina's first marriage were part of an extended, disciplined family. They were taught to play a number of musical instruments.\nCythna's father, Walter Edward Letty, had many career changes and the family were often uprooted. As a result Cythna attended a total of 13 schools, ending at the Pretoria Girls' High School. With the outbreak of World War I, Walter enlisted and served in France, and remained there after peace was declared. Josina supported the family by illustrating genealogical charts. Her artistic skills were passed on to a number of her children, but only Cythna had a passion for botanical subjects.\nCythna's main occupations until 1924 were teaching and nursing. For two years she worked as an artist, at the Veterinary Division at Onderstepoort near Pretoria, illustrating diseased and cancerous organs, after which she transferred to the Division of Plant Industry under Dr I.B. Pole-Evans. It was here that she started on 730 contributions to \"Flowering Plants of Africa\", an example of which is Anemone fanninii Harv. ex Mast.\nShe resigned in 1938 to marry Oscar William Alric Forssman. After producing a son, she rejoined the Division of Botany in 1945 and stayed until 1966. She was awarded a silver medal by the Royal Horticultural Society for her exhibition of flower paintings in 1970.\nHer interest in Zantedeschia led her to a study of the genus and her revision appeared in Bothalia 11: 5-26 (1973). She illustrated numerous books on botany such as the Botanical Survey Memoir Trees and shrubs in the Kruger National Park (1951) by L. E. W. Codd, who was at that time director of the Botanical Research Institute. Others were The Stapelieae (1937) by White & Sloane, and Grasses and Pastures of South Africa (1955) by Lucy K.A. Chippindall.

He has painted using oil paints for roughly thirty-five years.\nUsing a braille stylus to etch the outline of his drawing, Armağan requires total silence to create art. Oil paint is then applied with his fingers and left to dry fully before a new color is applied. This unique method is used so that colors do not smudge. The art pieces themselves are created without help from any individual. He is also able to create art that has visual perspective.\nIn 2004, he was the subject of a study of human perception, conducted by the psychologist [John M.Kennendy (psychologist)] of University of Toronto and proved that a person who is blind from birth can develop absolutely normally without visual contact with the outside world.\nIn 2008 two researchers from Harvard [Amir Amedi] and Alvaro Pascual-Leone, tried to find more about neural plasticity using Armağan as a study case.\nBoth scientists had evidence that in cases of blindness, the \"visual\" cortex acts differently from how it acts with the non-blind.\nPascual-Leone has found that Braille readers use  this very same area for touch.\nAmedi, together (with Ehud Zohary) at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, found that the area is also activated in verbal memory tasks.\nWhen Amedi analyzed the results, however, he found that Armağan's visual cortex lit up during the drawing task, but hardly at all for verbal recall, meaning that some unused visual areas might be used in collaboration with ones needs from the brain.\nMoreover, in scans that were held while Armağan drew, his visual cortex signals seemed as he was seeing to the extent that a naive viewer of his scan might assume Armağan really could see.\nArmağan is married and has two children. He has displayed his work at more than 20 exhibitions in Turkey, Italy, China, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. He has appeared several times on television and in the press in Turkey and has been on programs on BBC and ZD.\nIn 2009 Armağan was invited by Volvo to paint the new model S60 as part of a social media campaign. His work was documented in a series of videos posted on Volvo's Facebook page.  The resulting painting of the S60 sold on eBay for US $3,050.

Eleven years later his whole family moved to Montevideo, Uruguay.  At the age of 12 Seade began working as an assistant to the Muralist Enrique Albertazzi and the painter Guillermo Rodríguez. Under Rodríguez' influence Seade took some painting courses at the Fine Arts Circle school. He had his first show in 1925.  From 1931 well into the 1950s Seade presented work in many national and city halls.\nIn 1944, Seade began his parallel career as a teacher.

He wanted to paint for \"the people, not for the walls of the bourgeoisie\". He aspired to paint murals, the preferred way for his generation  to reach the masses, but the only murals he managed to finish were the one in Colonia and the  La marcha del Pueblo à la Piedra Alta (1939) at the Conference Hall of the Liceo de Florida.

Not from a tourist perspective, which he despised, but with the passion of a convinced social realist.\nSeade was also an expert draughtsman. His most public work was a long series of illustrations for a key local magazine, Mundo Uruguayo. His more private drawings were mostly sketches for paintings.\nAlthough Seade had an active participation in Salons and through his teaching was one of the more visible artists of Uruguay in his time, he disliked and avoided the world of galleries and art critics.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-12939", "doctext": "George Vincent (baptised 27 June 1796 – c.1832) was an English landscape artist who produced watercolours, etchings and oil paintings. He is considered by art historians to be one of the most talented of the Norwich School of painters, a group of artists connected by location and personal and professional relationships, who were mainly inspired by the Norfolk countryside. Vincent's work was founded on the Dutch school of landscape painting as well as the style of John Crome, also of the Norwich School. The school's reputation outside East Anglia in the 1820s was based largely upon the works of Vincent and his friend James Stark.\nThe son of a weaver, Vincent was educated at Norwich Grammar School and afterwards apprenticed to Crome. He exhibited at the Royal Academy, British Institution, and elsewhere. From 1811 until 1831 he showed at the Norwich Society of Artists, exhibiting more than a 100 pictures of Norfolk landscapes and marine works. By 1818 he had relocated to London, where in 1821 he married the supposedly wealthy daughter of a surgeon. There he obtained the patronage of wealthy clients, yet struggled financially. The purchase of an expensive house, combined with a tendency towards drink, exacerbated his financial problems and led to his incarceration in the Fleet Prison for debt in 1824. Before his release in 1827 he had resumed his connection with the Norwich Society of Artists, albeit with a much lower output of work.\nAfter 1831, Vincent disappeared. He was never found, despite attempts by his family to locate him, and his whereabouts after this date remain uncertain. His death may have occurred before April 1832, perhaps in Bath. His picture Greenwich Hospital from the River, which was shown in London three decades after his death, caused renewed interest in his paintings and helped to establish his reputation as a leading member of the Norwich School. The art historian Herbert Minton Cundall wrote in the 1920s that had Vincent \"not given way to intemperate habits he would probably have ranked amongst the foremost of British landscape painters\".", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["George Vincent", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1796", 33]]], "3_death": [[["1832", 42]]], "4_nationality": [[["British", 777]]]}}

He studied under Knud Bergslien in 1900, at Harriet Backer's painting school in Kristiania (now Oslo) from 1899 to 1900, and at Kristian Zahrtmann's painting school in Copenhagen the following two years. He debuted at the National Art Exhibition in 1902 with a painting of log driving. He found his motifs largely in his hometown's forestry and agriculture, and he eventually acquired a good reputation as a portrait painter.\n\nA portrait assignment took him to England and France, where he studied sculpture at the museums. He moved increasingly toward this form of expression while continuing to paint. After the First World War, he settled in Sandefjord, where his sculpture of the priest and hymn writer Magnus Brostrup Landstad was installed in 1928. This was the first time a public statue had been carved from Norwegian hardstein (a blue-gray schist). Together with Myllarguten (1940) at the Nordagutu train station, the Ulabrand monument in Ula (1933), and the bust of Harald Sohlberg in Røros, it is considered his main work.

He spent much of his young days at sea and probably had a naval career in mind. However, he was not admitted to the Norwegian Naval Academy.He moved to Kristiania, where he met painting student Per Deberitz, who was a student of Hans Gude and who probably turned Lund's interest to this profession. He was a pupil of Harriet Backer (1899), debuted the same year, and studied further with Johan Nordhagen (1903). Lund had his first exhibit in 1899 and his first Autumn Exhibit in 1901. He lived in Paris (1905, 1920–21) and exhibited in Berlin (1908). He lived in Copenhagen from 1904 to 1909 and broke through here. He held several notable exhibitions, including \"The Six\" in Berlin and Copenhagen in 1911.\nHe belonged to a group of early-1900s young painters called the Neo-Impressionists. He befriended such painters as Ludvig Karsten, Søren Onsager, Bernhard Folkestad, Arne Kavli, Theodor Laureng and Anders Svarstad, and drew inspiration from Karsten, Edvard Munch and Christian Krohg. In the years before the First World War began, Lund was interested in pure landscapes, open and airy impressions of nature. He found  motifs in the Oslo Fjord, Holmsbu and Nordland, but first and foremost at his summer place near Kragerø on Skåtøy. He had a special affinity towards landscapes and portrait painting. However, both as a painter and printmaker, he is primarily known for his portraits. He painted many of the leading men and women in business, culture and politics.\nLund was also a skilled administrator and a persistent advocate for his artist colleagues. Over the years he held a variety of administrative posts, both at home and abroad. In 1911 he held an exhibition for young Norwegian artists (\"The six\") at Cassirer in Berlin and Copenhagen. In 1912, he took a large Scandinavian exhibition on tour in the United States. He served on the art jury for the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition at Frogner and was chairman of the Association of Norwegian Printmakers (1919-1925).

This has also not been confirmed. His arrival at Simonstown in the Cape in April or May 1823 was as a result of malaria contracted in Moçambique while serving as second master under Captain Owen aboard HMS Leven, together with the brig Barracouta, 'an expedition for surveying the Eastern Coasts of Africa'. When the expedition returned in 1826, with some 300 new charts, detailing some 30,000 miles (48,000 km) of coastline, over half the original crew had succumbed to tropical diseases.\nOne of the first references to him was on 21 January 1824 when the South African Commercial Advertiser mentioned him as an 'able draughtsman' who had been commissioned to paint the portraits of Pedu and Teysho, two Bechuana chiefs who were visiting Cape Town. These portraits were included as engravings in the traveller George Thompson's (1796–1889) book \"Travels and Adventures in Southern Africa\" published in 1827.\nDe Meillon tutored the Cloete children at Groot Constantia from May 1825 until August 1825.

He painted in several cities in northern Italy \"with speed, vigor, and deliberate coarseness of expression and execution—intended to shock\".He appears to have visited Rome, and learnt from its High Renaissance masterpieces, but lacked a good training in anatomical drawing.  Like Polidoro da Caravaggio, he was one of the artists often commissioned to paint the exteriors of buildings; of such work at most a shadow survives after centuries of weather. Michelangelo is said to have approved of one palace facade in 1527; it is now only known from a preparatory drawing.  Much of his work was lost when the Doge's Palace in Venice was largely destroyed by fires in 1574 and 1577.  A number of fresco cycles survive, for example part of one at Cremona Cathedral, where his Passion scenes have a violence hardly repeated until Goya.  Another cycle was at the Scuola Grande della Carità in Venice, now the Gallerie dell'Accademia, the main art museum, where he worked with the young Tintoretto.\nHis life was as energetic and restless as his art; he married three times, and was accused in court of hiring criminals to kill his brother to avoid sharing their inheritance.

He studied at the Royal Academy, beginning in 1843. His modest early success as a portrait painter was stifled by the development of photography (a problem shared by other artists of the time). In 1851 Smetham took a teaching position at the Wesleyan Normal College in Westminster, and was the first Drawing Master for what would later become Westminster College (today part of Oxford Brookes University). In 1854, he married Sarah Goble, a fellow teacher at the College. They would eventually have six children. \nSmetham worked in a range of genres, including religious and literary themes as well as portraiture; but he is perhaps best known as a landscape painter. His \"landscapes have a visionary quality\" reminiscent of the work of William Blake, John Linnell, and Samuel Palmer. Out of a lifetime output of some 430 paintings and 50 etchings, woodcuts, and book illustrations, his 1856 painting The Dream is perhaps his best-known work but his signal work is The Hymn of the Last Supper a very ambitious subject for him to undertake but one which worked out magnificently. His choice of subject was sometimes somewhat bizarre; one of his best paintings is The Death of Earl Siward which depicts the dying earl, dressed in full armour, standing up and being supported by his servants as 'He did not wish to die lying down like a cow'.\nHe was also an essayist and art critic; an article on Blake (in the form of a review of Alexander Gilchrist's Life of William Blake), which appeared in the January 1869 issue of the Quarterly Review, influenced and advanced recognition of Blake's artistic importance. Other Smetham articles for the Review were \"Religious Art in England\" (1861), \"The Life and Times of Sir Joshua Reynolds\" (1866), and \"Alexander Smith\" (1868). He also wrote some poetry.\nSmetham was a devout Methodist, and after a mental breakdown in 1857, the second half of his life was marked by a growing religious mania and eventual insanity. \"In one of his notebooks he attempted to illustrate every verse in the Bible.\" (Smetham habitually created miniature, postage-stamp-sized pen-and-ink drawings, in a process he called \"squaring.\" He produced thousands of these in his lifetime.) He suffered a final breakdown in 1877 and lived in seclusion at his home in Stoke Newington until his death.\nSmetham's letters, posthumously published by his widow, throw light upon Rossetti, John Ruskin, and other contemporaries, and have been praised for their literary and spiritual qualities. His surviving journals and notebooks show that Smetham practised an almost stream of consciousness type of writing that he called \"ventilating,\" as a method of religious self-analysis. These writings delineate the depression that came to dominate Smetham's outlook.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["James Smetham", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1821", 27]]], "3_death": [[["1889", 45]]], "4_nationality": [[["British", 0]]]}}

He was the son of the eminent Flemish Renaissance painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder. A close friend and frequent collaborator with Peter Paul Rubens, the two artists were the leading Flemish painters in the first three decades of the 17th century.\nBrueghel worked in many genres including history paintings, flower still lifes, allegorical and mythological scenes, landscapes and seascapes, hunting pieces, village scenes, battle scenes and scenes of hellfire and the underworld. He was an important innovator who invented new types of paintings such as flower garland paintings, paradise landscapes, and gallery paintings in the first quarter of the 17th century. He further created genre paintings that were imitations, pastiches and reworkings of his father's works, in particular his father's genre scenes and landscapes with peasants. Brueghel represented the type of the pictor doctus, the erudite painter whose works are informed by the religious motifs and aspirations of the Catholic Counter-Reformation as well as the scientific revolution with its interest in accurate description and classification. He was court painter of the Archduke and Duchess Albrecht and Isabella, the governors of the Habsburg Netherlands.\nThe artist was nicknamed \"Velvet\" Brueghel, \"Flower\" Brueghel, and \"Paradise\" Brueghel. The first is believed to have been given him because of his mastery in the rendering of fabrics. The second nickname is a reference to his specialization in flower still lifes and the last one to his invention of the genre of the paradise landscape. His brother Pieter Brueghel the Younger was traditionally nicknamed \"de helse Brueghel\" or \"Hell Brueghel\" because it was believed he was the author of a number of paintings with fantastic depictions of fire and grotesque imagery.

He was one of the earliest authors on entomology and first to write on the insects of the Netherlands and Europe, based on his own observations and experiments between 1635 and 1667.\nGoedaert was born in Middelburg  where he was baptized on 19 March 1617. His mother was  Judith Pottier and his father Pieter Goedaert died when he was eight years old. At the age of 18 he became a member of the Saint Lucas Guild for painters. Hardly anything is known about Goedaert’s training in draughtsmanship and painting. He was a contemporary of such painters as Adriaen van de Venne, Francois Ryckhals, Mattheus Molanus and Christoffel van den Berghe, who were active in Middelburg in the first half of the 17th century. As van den Berghe included paintings of insects in his work, it has been suggested that he might have been Goedaert’s teacher. However, this is not certain.  Goedaert published, in his birthplace, a book entitled Metamorphosis Naturalis between 1660 and 1669, which was translated into French in 1668-1669 as Histoire Naturelle des Insectes, in Latin \"Metamorphosis et Historia Naturalis Insectorum\" and by Martin Lister in 1682 into English as Johannes Godartius of Insects with plates by Francis Place. The book shows meticulous observations of the growth phases of insects, including metamorphosis. The life histories of parasites was not fully understood by Goedaert and he thought that caterpillars could either produce adult flies or butterflies. Throughout his life he collected, raised and studied insect larvae and maggots. He not only described the process of their development but also painted and drew the various stages the insects passed through during their life cycle. He was also the first person to give Dutch names to many types of insects found in and around Middelburg. Goedaert was a natural theologian and believed that his studies revealed the genius of the Creator. He also believed that there was a limit to exploration and did not make use of a microscope. He believed that the attraction of insects to candles was a warning to those who were excessively curious. He stimulated interest in insects and generated further research in this field through the text and the detailed illustrations in his books. Goedaert also questioned ideas of his time that mosquitoes were spontaneously created from dew. He illustrated and noted that their larvae emerged from eggs. Some landscape and still-life paintings made by Goedaert have also survived.Goedaert married Clara de Bock, the daughter of a jeweller, around 1643. The couple lived on the Molenwater in Middelburg. They had three children. Jacob was born in 1645 and became a ship’s surgeon. Johannes Jr. was born in 1656 and rose to be a lieutenant in the army of William III, the Dutch Stadholder and King of England. The couple also had a daughter but her name and details are unknown. Goedaert died in January 1668 after an active life and was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk in his home town of Middelburg on 15 January 1668.\nIn 1669, about eighteen months after Goedaert’s death, Jan Swammerdam (1637–1680) published his book Historia Insectorum Generalis, in which he wrote that Goedaert had observed and described more insects than anyone before him. However, Swammerdam then went on to criticize Goedaert’s work.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Jan Goedart", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1617", 98]]], "3_death": [[["1668", 127]]], "4_nationality": [[["Dutch", 148]]]}}

{"docid": "Wikipedia-19763", "doctext": "John Cranch (February 2, 1807 – January 12, 1891) was an American painter and print collector.Cranch was born in Washington, D.C., the third son of judge William Cranch; his younger brother was the poet and painter Christopher Pearse Cranch, and his elder brother Edward was also an artist. Like Christopher, he was a graduate of Columbian College; at his commencement in 1826 he read a poem of his own composition, \"Painting\", suggesting that he had already determined on his future career. William Dunlap claimed that he studied with Chester Harding, Charles Bird King, and Thomas Sully, though he provided no details; this would be unsurprising, however, as all three artists had been active in Washington before 1829, in which year Cranch first advertised his services as a portraitist.Cranch traveled to Italy in 1830, bearing a letter of introduction from John Quincy Adams, a cousin, to Charles R. Leslie. He spent four years there, mainly in Florence and Venice, becoming friends with Hiram Powers and associating with visiting Americans, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson. He studied the work of the Old Masters and continued to paint, creating portraits, genre scenes, and depictions of scenes from Shakespeare. Traveling companions during his time in Italy included Henry and Horatio Greenough and Thomas Cole; other friends from his career included Charles Lanman and John Mix Stanley. Cranch returned to the United States in 1834 and settled in New York City, but did not show in an annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design until 1838. In 1839 he became a Swedenborgian. That year he showed three works in the annual exhibition; these were a portrait of a child, a study of an old man \"painted at Rome\", and The Valley of the Shadow of Death. This last, based on the 23rd Psalm and meant as an inspirational work, received scant notice, and the one reviewer that did pay it mind wrote derisively of its composition.After apparently working in North Carolina briefly, Cranch traveled to Cincinnati in the autumn of 1839, and soon became active in the local art community; he served as president of the Fine Arts Section of the Hamilton County Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, at whose exhibition in 1842 he showed a portrait of Charles Dickens, then visiting the United States. He married Charlotte Davis Appleton in 1845 and moved to Boston; in 1846 he exhibited at the Boston Athenaeum. At this point in his career he spent some time in Washington again, where he shared studio space with George Caleb Bingham. He returned to New York in 1848, and kept a studio in the New York University Building from 1849 to 1852. The following year he began sharing a space at 806 Broadway with his brother Christopher, remaining there until 1854; he exhibited at the National Academy during both of the years in question, and was named an associate in 1853. Nevertheless, he moved again, back to Washington, in 1855. There he soon became involved with the Washington Art Association, then newly formed, for which organization he served as director and, later, corresponding secretary. He was also active, along with William Wilson Corcoran and George Peter Alexander Healy, in attempts to set up a national gallery and school of art in Washington. In 1858 he exhibited with the National Academy one last time, again The Valley of the Shadow of Death; that was also the last year in which the Washington city directory showed him as an artist, as from then until he left the city he was listed as \"postal clerk\" in the rolls. He left Washington in 1878 and disappears from the record until 1885, when he is listed as a portraitist in Urbana, Ohio, where his son-in-law was serving as president of Urbana University. He died in Urbana, and was memorialized by the Academy on January 12, 1891. He is buried at Oakdale Cemetery in Urbana.A self-portrait by Cranch is today in the collection of the National Academy. His papers, including a journal copied by his wife Charlotte from his original, are currently in the Archives of American Art. At his death, she donated many of his prints to the Academy, while engravings he owned of Renaissance art were presented to the Smithsonian Institution and are today part of the graphic arts collection of the National Museum of American History.

He was the author of a book, Men I Have Painted. In the book he writes of himself thus,\n\nAs I grow older the advantage of having been born an American of British and French blood becomes daily more ideal. I now know that I have escaped the insulating influences and the national prejudices of all three countries, and have retained only their qualities — mainly good. \nIn a review of the book, which reveals insights into some famous personalities of the time, the New York Times wrote, \"... his chats about his sitters are delightfully without pretense ... if his portrait turns out a bad one, he mentions it\".The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography said of the book, \n\nFor Philadelphians who have known J. McLure Hamilton as a fellow townsman — even if a somewhat cosmopolitan one who dissembles his love for his native city by very rarely remaining in it for any length of time, much to the regret of his numerous friends — the dictum of Mary Drew, one of the Gladstone family, that 'it is doubtful if there is one individuality more unusual or more interesting than that of the writer himself' will be accepted as final and quite a summing up of his gossipy new book 'Men I Have Painted,' with 48 portraits. ... But, a book which deals with Bismarck, Asquith, Balfour, Manning, Tyndall, Spencer, General Booth, G. F. Watts and George Meredith, selecting a few of the more world-famous names cannot be but fascinating especially in these days of the craze for personality in biography. Here is indeed revealed the man and his manner and his method and the character of a great period in modern life as is set out by human beings who find in this singularly human being, Hamilton, the painter, a true interpreter of manners and of men.\" \nHamilton was a member of  the American Federation of Arts, the Philadelphia Water Color Club, the Pastel Society, the Royal Society of Portrait Painters  and the Senefelder Club, London.

Jan trained at a German art school at Poznań. With his parents and four siblings he migrated to Australia, reaching Sydney in January 1882. The family settled at Wollongong, New South Wales, where his father and he worked in the coalmines. His parents had two more children in Australia. Moving to Sydney in 1883, Jan attended art classes. He boarded with the Saunders family from England at Oxford Street, Paddington, and on 17 May 1888 married their daughter Emma at the local district registrar's office. Living at Hurstville, John (as he was now known) was naturalized in November 1904 according to the Australian Naturalization Act of 1903.\nFrom 1885 Radecki had been employed by Frederick Ashwin, who taught him to work with glass. In the 1890s the two men had crafted stained-glass windows entitled 'Sermon on the Mount' (St Paul's Church, Cobbitty) and 'Nativity' (St Jude's, Randwick). Other works included a window at Yanco Agricultural College, produced in 1902 by F. Ashwin & Co. reputedly to Radecki's design, and the chancel window (1903) in St Clement's, Mosman. His first, major independent work was the 'Te Deum' window in Christ Church St Laurence, Sydney, in 1906. Ashwin and Radecki also collaborated on windows in St James's, Forest Lodge, and St John's, Campbelltown.\nFollowing Ashwin's death in 1909, Radecki became chief designer for J. Ashwin & Co, in partnership with Frederick's brother John; he was proprietor of the company from John Ashwin's death in 1920 until 1954. The largest glassmaking establishment in Sydney, with a high reputation, the firm created the chapel windows for St Scholastica's Convent, Glebe, in the early 1930s. Radecki's work included windows in such churches as St John the Evangelist's, Campbelltown, St Patrick's, Kogarah, St Joseph's, Rockdale, St Matthew's, Manly, and Our Lady of Dolours', North Goulburn, Scots Kirk, Hamilton, Newcastle, and the Presbyterian Church, Wollongong.\nA church committee-member during the building in 1928 of St Declan's Catholic Church, Penshurst, Radecki designed, produced and donated the stained-glass windows there, including a memorial window dedicated to his wife, who had died in 1919. On 8 January 1921 at the Church of Christ, Hurstville, Radecki married Sydney-born Jean Hughes (d.1944).\nDuring the 1920s J. Ashwin & Co. produced the stained glass for the impressive, vaulted ceiling of what became the Commonwealth Savings Bank in Martin Place to designs by Radecki. These had an Australian character, illustrating 'the basic sources of wealth': sheep and cattle grazing, agriculture, mining, shipping and building; stockmen, carpenters, gold panning, farming and wharf labourers were shown alongside a typical banking scene. A window for the reading room of the Mitchell Library, signed 'John Radecki, Sydney 1941', depicted the printer William Caxton with the first book printed in English.\nRadecki's strengths were a natural aptitude for figure drawing and composition, an eye for colour, which he used as a compositional device, an outstanding knowledge of his medium and facility with techniques in glass painting. His recreational passion was playing chess. He died on 10 May 1955 in his home at Hurstville, and was buried with Catholic rites in Woronora cemetery. The six daughters and three sons of his first marriage survived him. His daughter Winifred Siedlecky continued the company until the building's owners demolished the premises in Dixon Street in 1961.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["John Radecki", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1865", 62]]], "3_death": [[["1955", 76]]], "4_nationality": [[["Australian", 909]]]}}

As art director at Universal Pictures for the bulk of the 1930s, Grosz oversaw the company's advertising campaigns and contributed hundreds of his own illustrations. He is especially recognized for his dramatic, colorful posters for classic horror films. Grosz's best-known posters advertised early Universal Classic Monsters films such as Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931), The Mummy (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Beyond the horror genre, his other notable designs include posters for the epic war film All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) and the screwball comedy My Man Godfrey (1936).\nOriginal lithograph copies of his poster art are scarce and highly valued by collectors. Two posters illustrated by Grosz—ads for Frankenstein and The Mummy, respectively—have set the auction record for the world's most expensive film poster. The latter held the record for nearly 20 years and, at the time of its sale in 1997, it may have been the most expensive art print of any kind, including other forms of commercial art as well as fine art. The reference website LearnAboutMoviePosters (LAMP) noted that, as of August 2016, Grosz appeared more than any other artist on its comprehensive list of vintage film posters sold for at least $20,000.Despite the growth in his artwork's valuation and prominence, very little biographical information about Grosz is known. He was born in Hungary around 1896, immigrated to the United States in 1901, became a naturalized American citizen, lived in New York, and worked in film advertising between approximately 1920 and 1938. Only a small portion of his artistic output has been attributed to him, reflecting the standard anonymity of early American film poster artists.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Karoly Grosz", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1890", 0]]], "3_death": [], "4_nationality": [[["Hungarian", 36], ["American", 102]]]}}
