Consequently, he moved to Haarlem where he was apprenticed to the artist Pieter Frederik van Os. During his stay in Haarlem he befriended Paul Gabriël and Hendrik Dirk Kruseman Van Elten who were also studying with Van Os.\nIn 1853, together with his two friends, De Haas decided to go to Oosterbeek. Here they came into contact with the influential landscape painter Johannes Warnardus Bilders and the group of painters which had gathered around him, many of whom would later be part of the Hague School. De Haas also met his future wife in Oosterbeek, Bilders' daughter, Caroline. In 1855 he received good reviews for his pictures that were exhibited in Paris from the noted art critic Jean Baptiste Gustave Planche.\nIn 1857 De Haas first went to Brussels, where he became friends with Willem Roelofs. De Haas frequently returned to the Netherlands and Oosterbeek for inspiration and Caroline.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-19600", "doctext": "Johannes Spitler (October 2, 1774-April 18, 1837) was an American painter of furniture.\nLittle is recorded about Spitler's life, but he is known to have been born in the community of Massanutten, Virginia, in a portion of Shenandoah County which later became part of Page County. He worked from the 1790s until around 1810, by which point he had moved to Fairfield County, Ohio. His style is distinctive; historians have posited that its uniqueness was informed by the geographic and social isolation of the community in which he lived and worked. Many of his pieces were traditional, while others incorporated natural imagery in addition to abstract patterns. He used the same palette throughout his career, red, blue, white, and black. He initialed all of his work, and kept a list of his pieces, which shows that at the peak of his career he was creating nearly twenty-five works a year. The majority of pieces Spitler painted were blanket chests, many of yellow pine; whether or not he made them himself, or merely painted them, is unknown. Two tall clock cases have also been attributed to him. One of the latter bears the signature of Jacob Strickler, a neighbor and relative by marriage who was also a fraktur artist; it underlines the influence which fraktur drawings had on furniture design in the German American community. Two unsigned pieces dating to after Spitler's move to Ohio have been ascribed to him, but their date is unknown; it is not known if he continued his artistic career after moving. He died in Ohio.Several pieces by Spitler were included in an exhibition of Virginia folk art at Colonial Williamsburg in 1973, an event which led to the identification of a body of work by Donald R. Walters. Today the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum owns a chest painted by Spitler, as well as one of the clocks. Other chests are held by the Museum of the Shenandoah Valley, the Winterthur Museum, and the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts. The American Folk Art Museum owns two chests and the second clock, which was a gift from Ralph Esmerian. Another chest sold at auction in 2015 for $356,500.\n\n\n== References ==", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1774", 29]]], "death": [[["1837", 44]]], "nationality": [[["American", 57]]], "painter_name": [[["Johannes Spitler", 0]]]}}

He was called a \"remarkable and imaginative painter\" by the critic and historian Christopher Wood in Victorian Painting (1999).Grimshaw’s love for realism stemmed from a passion for photography, which would eventually lend itself to the creative process. Though entirely self-taught, he is known to have used a camera obscura or lenses to project scenes onto canvas, which made up for his shortcomings as a draughtsman and his imperfect knowledge of perspective. This technique, allegedly used by Caravaggio, as well as Vermeer, was condemned by a number of his contemporaries who believed it demonstrated less skill than painting by eye, with some claiming that his paintings appeared to \"show no marks of handling or brushwork\", while others \"were doubtful whether they could be accepted as paintings at all\". However, many recognised his mastery of colour, lighting and shadow, as well as his unique ability to provoke strong emotional responses in the viewer. James McNeill Whistler, who Grimshaw worked with in his Chelsea studios, stated, “I considered myself the inventor of nocturnes until I saw Grimmy’s moonlit pictures.” His early paintings were signed \"JAG\", \"J.

His most famous work is his Portrait of a Man in a Black Cap. His son John Bettes the Younger, with whom he is sometimes confused, was a pupil of Nicholas Hilliard who painted portraits during the reign of Elizabeth I and James I.\n\nNothing is known of John Bettes's life, except that he was living in Westminster in 1556, according to a documented court case. He is first recorded as working for Henry VIII at Whitehall Palace in 1531. Queen Catherine Parr's accounts for 1546/47 record payments to Bettes for \"lymning\" (painting in miniature) the king's and queen's portraits, and for six other portraits. Her new year's gift of 1547 to Prince Edward was a pair of portraits of the king and herself. Bettes has been identified as the designer of the engraved title-border for William Cuningham's Cosmographical Glasse, printed by John Day in 1559. He may also be the designer of engravings for Edward Hall's Chronicle, published in 1550, and of a woodcut portrait of Franz Burchard, the Saxon ambassador to England, published in 1560. In 1576, John Foxe referred to Bettes as already dead. An earlier second edition of Foxe's Actes and Monuments printed in 1570 refers to Bettes' death.The identification of John Bettes's work stems from the inscription on the back of Man in a Black Cap: \"faict par Johan Bettes Anglois\" (\"done by John Bettes, Englishman\"). The painting is dated 1545 on the front. On the basis of its style, four further portraits have been attributed to Bettes: two of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Baron Wentworth, (1549); one of Sir William Butts the Younger (154/3?); and one of Sir William Cavendish (c. 1545).", "extracts": {"birth": [], "death": [], "nationality": [], "painter_name": [[["John Bettes the Elder", 0]]]}}

{"docid": "Wikipedia-19714", "doctext": "John William Buxton Knight RBA (1843 – 2 January 1908), English landscape painter, was born in Sevenoaks, Kent.\nHe started as a schoolmaster, but painting was his hobby, and he subsequently devoted himself to it. In 1861 he had his first picture hung at the Royal Academy. He was essentially an open-air painter, constantly going on sketching tours in the most picturesque spots of England, and all his pictures were painted out of doors. He died at Dover on 2 January 1908.The Chantrey trustees bought Knight's \"December's Bareness Everywhere\" for the nation in February 1908. Most of his best pictures had passed into the collection of Mr Iceton of Putney (including \"White Walls of Old England\" and \"Hereford Cathedral\"), Mr Walter Briggs of Burley in Wharfedale (especially \"Pinner\"), and Mr SM Phillips of Wrotham (especially two watercolours of Richmond Bridge).John William Buxton Knight was an English landscape painter who was true to nature and never weakened his conviction to become fashionable. \"To speak of him as the successor of Constable would not be without justification, not because he consciously or purposefully based himself upon that master, but because he had much of his predecessor’s spirit and unconventionality of method, and, as well, a full share of his artistic intelligence.\"Born in Sevenoaks, Kent to William Knight (1810 – 1878; accomplished artist and teacher of art), ‘Buxton Knight’ began his art studies at an early age, although not in any formal and systematic manner, but by working in the open air and observing nature. Knole Park in Sevenoaks was popular with many notable artists, who Buxton Knight made acquaintance with, helping inform his future path that included: \"a high position amongst the great exponents of English landscape…. which Constable and Crome would have been the first to recognise.\"At the age of 22 Buxton Knight went as a student into the Academy schools on the advice of Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, and was there for just two years. Prior to these formal studies he was already an exhibiting painter, having contributed his first canvas to the Academy at the age of 18 in 1861. He continued to exhibit at the Academy throughout his career and until the end of his life, with a total of 72 paintings. His last exhibition was in 1907 and subsequent to his death the following year, one of his two paintings exhibited in 1907, Old December Bareness Everywhere, was acquired by the Chantrey Bequest and bequeathed to the Tate for the benefit of the Nation.\nDespite exhibiting such a large number of paintings at the Royal Academy throughout his lifetime, Buxton Knight was never admitted as an Associate or an Academician, despite having been put forward numerous times. A year after his death, E Barrington Nash wrote: \"I am informed that Mr Knight’s name has lately been placed upon the list of candidates for the Royal Academy Associateship, but surely, with such great masterly works as ‘Dover’, ‘White Walls’, ‘Littlehampton’, ‘Hop-picking’, ‘Poole’, ‘Richmond Park’, (White Lodge), and many others en evidence before us, it is a matter of national disgrace that he has not been admitted a full-fledged R.A. long ago.\"\"There are few types of landscape that he has not painted: coast subjects, river scenery, mountains, moorland, and quiet stretches of pastoral meadow-land; all have been recorded by him at some time or other. As he wishes to associate only with her [Nature], he has to be ever out and about. And for the greater part of the year he lived in the open, painting industriously through spring, summer, and autumn, returning only when the winter winds make the nomad existence impossible even to the greatest art enthusiast…. Few modern landscape painters can affirm the same absolute self-sacrifice, or can plead that they have to such an extent subordinated the not unnatural inclination to assert individuality at the expense of fidelity to nature. That he should have done so all his life speaks well for his consistency, and implies a rare quality of belief in the soundest principals of art.\"\"While we have painters like John Buxton Knight to keep alive the best traditions of the English landscape school, there is certainly no fear that we shall lose our pre-eminent position among the nations which have produced the greater masters in this form of pictorial practice…. It is because Mr Buxton Knight has attacked and mastered the intricacies of British landscape and has made himself a typical exponent of all that is most characteristic in our insular atmosphere that it is possible to claim for him a place among the chief living leaders of our native art. For he represents more adequately than most of our present-day landscape painters what may be called legitimate school. He follows closely the old-established tradition, the sound and logical tradition, adopted by such masters as Constable, De Wint, and David Cox, which imposes upon all students of nature the obligation to observe shrewdly and to set down what they have observed with unhesitating individuality. He does not imitate his predecessors or formulate his practice in any unwise effort to reproduce their personal mannerisms and tricks of style; but he seeks, as they did, to see absolutely with his own eyes and by the frankest use of his own personality to give vitality and authority to his productions.\"\"Mr Knight in his nomadic existence is a living protest against convention. The ordinary confinement of a studio would become impossible to a man so devotedly attached to his mistress – Nature. Whatever he does is on the spot and there only. He lives and paints in the open nine months out of the twelve, in all weathers, sunshine or storm, seeing and studying Nature in every visible mood.\"Within Sir Alfred Munnings’ autobiography there is a story of a bet that he had with the Director of Leeds City Art Gallery (which has 31 Buxton Knight paintings), whether Buxton Knight had painted ‘Ingleborough Hall, Yorkshire’ in the open air, which the Director did not think could be done. It transpired with Munnings tracking down a retired postman in the neighbouring village of Clapham, Yorkshire, who confirmed that he passed Buxton Knight daily, sat off the footpath working on the big painting. One day the postman took Buxton Knight a letter, which he opened there, saying it brought him bad news as the Royal Academy had not elected him as Associate. Munnings comments that it was \"a story of the dashed hopes of one of our finest landscape-painters; a story reflecting little credit upon members of the Academy.\"Within Ann Galbally's book \"A Remarkable Friendship – Vincent Van Gogh and John Peter Russell\", there is mention that \"…Buxton Knight another friend of Russell and [Tom] Roberts, and known to Edward Combes, became something of a mentor to Roberts, Russell and other visiting Australian students, including E Phillips Fox. An interpreter of the cool, tonal landscape, tranquil and slightly melancholy at times, with a preference for autumnal scenes and twilight tones.... he became a foundation member of the New English Art Club in 1888. Combes nominated him for membership of the Art Society of New South Wales, where he exhibited in 1882 and 1883, years that Combes was president. One of his March 1883 exhibits, ‘Halcyon Days by Murmuring Stream’ was acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, along with another, ‘Deserted’, when Combes was President of Trustees. Knight returned the compliment by painting and exhibiting at the Royal Academy ‘La Peruse, Botany Bay. After Edward Combes’. Knight kept in touch with Russell during his Paris years and with Roberts when he returned to Melbourne, even becoming the subject of a request for an introduction from Roberts by the young Charles Conder in 1890.\"An obituary in the Examiner on 15 February 1908 remarked of Buxton Knight’s passing as follows: \"Death of a great artist. One of the greatest modern British landscape painters passed away recently, though his death and the loss caused by it to the art of his country have remained practically unnoticed. There are many connoisseurs who hold the late Mr Buxton Knight to be the equal, if not the superior, of the very leaders of modern landscape painting in Great Britain, though his work, like that of Arthur Melville or J Charles, was not very well known to the large public while the artist himself was still among the living. Mr Buxton Knight, who first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1861, excelled chiefly in his strong virile oil paintings of the English countryside, which were always remarkable for their firmness of handling and the sense of structure, of the solidity, of all objects.\"Within a review of an \"Art Exhibition of English Paintings\" on 2 January 1928, the quality of Buxton Knight was pronounced when describing an exhibited painting of his: \"The character of ‘Near Chertsey’, by the late J Buxton Knight, is best described by saying that we should like to see it hung between a Constable and a Sisley – with a Monet to complete the sequence – as marking a definite stage in the logical development of Impressionism.\"", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1843", 32]]], "death": [[["1908", 49]]], "nationality": [[["British", 4435]]], "painter_name": [[["John Buxton Knight", 4107]]]}}

He studied art in Würzburg, left home in his teens and supported himself by restoring paintings in churches and monasteries in Italy, Switzerland and France. \nIn 1911, John Carl immigrated to the U.S. to avoid mandatory military service in  Kaiser Wilhelm II's army. He journeyed promptly to Chicago, Illinois to live with his uncle Gustav Doemling and family in the historic Pullman district. His uncle, Gustav, as general foreman in the Cabinet Department for the Pullman Palace Car Company, got Carl a job as a letterer.  Carl eventually became a draftsman and designer.\nWhile working, Carl studied at the Art Institute of Chicago along with Walt Disney.

Carl thought Disney was crazy. He did not accept. He later learned how wrong he had been.\"\nIn 1919, Carl had his first solo exhibit with the Palette and Chisel Club. He displayed thirty five paintings ranging from $15 to $400 in price. During the 1920s he made many trips to art colonies throughout the U.S. including Los Angeles and Laguna Beach.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-19760", "doctext": "John Cotton (17 December 1801 – 14 December 1849) was a British poet, ornithological writer and artist, who became an early pastoral settler in Victoria, Australia.\nCotton was born in Balham, London and educated in Richmond.  Afterwards he was articled to a firm of solicitors at Lincoln's Inn for a time, before focusing his interest on art and ornithology.  In 1829 he became a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London.  In 1835 he published privately The Resident Song Birds of Great Britain, with 17 colour plates and descriptive text, as well as The Song Birds of Great Britain, with 16 pages in colour.In 1843 Cotton migrated with his family (comprising his wife Susanna and nine children) to the Port Phillip District of New South Wales in Australia, now better known as the state of Victoria.  Following his arrival in Melbourne he leased from the government two pastoral properties on the Goulburn River where he farmed sheep.  In 1847 Susanna gave birth to their tenth child and sixth daughter.From 1844 Cotton was preparing sketches for a book to be named Birds of Port Phillip, as well as accumulating a collection of bird skins.  However, circumstances were against him; John Gould's monumental illustrated handbook The Birds of Australia, issued in seven volumes from 1840 to 1848, was dominating the potential market for Cotton's intended publication, and there was little interest in, or appreciation for, his paintings.  Moreover, he died in 1849, three days before his 48th birthday, his wife dying three years later, and his artwork remained unpublished, scattered among his descendants and largely lost to the world for the next 120 years.In 1974 a limited edition book, John Cotton's Birds of the Port Phillip District of New South Wales 1843-1849, authored by Allan McEvey was published, containing reproductions of some of the illustrations Cotton had prepared for the book that never eventuated.  In it McEvey concludes his account of Cotton's life with:\n\n\"But apart from his historical position, apart from his records of value, he was to have a continuing if indirect link with Australian ornithology through the marriages of his children.  A grandson-in-law, W.H.D. Le Souef (1857–1923) was to be a founder of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists' Union and its fourth President; another, Colonel Sir Charles Ryan (1853–1926) was its third President; a grand-daughter, Mrs Ellis Rowan, was to attain renown for her flower and bird painting; and a great-grand-daughter, Maie Ryan, as Her Excellency the Lady Casey, was to declare open the 67th R.A.O.U. Congress at Canberra in 1968, and now, at last, to achieve for John Cotton the publication of these selected drawings from his Birds of Port Phillip.\nGentle, sensitive, artistic, and educated in the age of the Grand Tour, John Cotton was a man of the time not an innovator; in natural history a compiler and painter rather than a chronicler.  In ornithology his capacity and ambition to be more than a naturalist in Colonial solitude were hampered by distance, impoverished by lack of encouragement, and ended with his early death.\n\nHe had been trained however to appreciate a quality of life and he remained true to himself and to that spirit of his age.  As shown by numerous entries and sketches in his journals he loved Antiquity no less than Nature.  In his own words, in one of his lines of poetry, 'Sweet [was] the retrospect of classic lore.'  In this, one hopes, there lay a solace for him.\"", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1801", 25]]], "death": [[["1849", 44]]], "nationality": [[["British", 56]]], "painter_name": [[["John Cotton", 0]]]}}

{"docid": "Wikipedia-19763", "doctext": "John Cranch (February 2, 1807 – January 12, 1891) was an American painter and print collector.Cranch was born in Washington, D.C., the third son of judge William Cranch; his younger brother was the poet and painter Christopher Pearse Cranch, and his elder brother Edward was also an artist. Like Christopher, he was a graduate of Columbian College; at his commencement in 1826 he read a poem of his own composition, \"Painting\", suggesting that he had already determined on his future career. William Dunlap claimed that he studied with Chester Harding, Charles Bird King, and Thomas Sully, though he provided no details; this would be unsurprising, however, as all three artists had been active in Washington before 1829, in which year Cranch first advertised his services as a portraitist.Cranch traveled to Italy in 1830, bearing a letter of introduction from John Quincy Adams, a cousin, to Charles R. Leslie. He spent four years there, mainly in Florence and Venice, becoming friends with Hiram Powers and associating with visiting Americans, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson. He studied the work of the Old Masters and continued to paint, creating portraits, genre scenes, and depictions of scenes from Shakespeare. Traveling companions during his time in Italy included Henry and Horatio Greenough and Thomas Cole; other friends from his career included Charles Lanman and John Mix Stanley. Cranch returned to the United States in 1834 and settled in New York City, but did not show in an annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design until 1838. In 1839 he became a Swedenborgian. That year he showed three works in the annual exhibition; these were a portrait of a child, a study of an old man \"painted at Rome\", and The Valley of the Shadow of Death. This last, based on the 23rd Psalm and meant as an inspirational work, received scant notice, and the one reviewer that did pay it mind wrote derisively of its composition.After apparently working in North Carolina briefly, Cranch traveled to Cincinnati in the autumn of 1839, and soon became active in the local art community; he served as president of the Fine Arts Section of the Hamilton County Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, at whose exhibition in 1842 he showed a portrait of Charles Dickens, then visiting the United States. He married Charlotte Davis Appleton in 1845 and moved to Boston; in 1846 he exhibited at the Boston Athenaeum. At this point in his career he spent some time in Washington again, where he shared studio space with George Caleb Bingham. He returned to New York in 1848, and kept a studio in the New York University Building from 1849 to 1852. The following year he began sharing a space at 806 Broadway with his brother Christopher, remaining there until 1854; he exhibited at the National Academy during both of the years in question, and was named an associate in 1853. Nevertheless, he moved again, back to Washington, in 1855. There he soon became involved with the Washington Art Association, then newly formed, for which organization he served as director and, later, corresponding secretary. He was also active, along with William Wilson Corcoran and George Peter Alexander Healy, in attempts to set up a national gallery and school of art in Washington. In 1858 he exhibited with the National Academy one last time, again The Valley of the Shadow of Death; that was also the last year in which the Washington city directory showed him as an artist, as from then until he left the city he was listed as \"postal clerk\" in the rolls. He left Washington in 1878 and disappears from the record until 1885, when he is listed as a portraitist in Urbana, Ohio, where his son-in-law was serving as president of Urbana University. He died in Urbana, and was memorialized by the Academy on January 12, 1891. He is buried at Oakdale Cemetery in Urbana.A self-portrait by Cranch is today in the collection of the National Academy. His papers, including a journal copied by his wife Charlotte from his original, are currently in the Archives of American Art. At his death, she donated many of his prints to the Academy, while engravings he owned of Renaissance art were presented to the Smithsonian Institution and are today part of the graphic arts collection of the National Museum of American History. Several of his drawings are owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A portrait of his father hangs in the Ceremonial Courtroom of the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington. An 1830 portrait of John Quincy Adams was destroyed in the 1851 fire at the Library of Congress; he painted Adams on three other occasions as well.\n\n\n== References ==", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1807", 25]]], "death": [[["1891", 44]]], "nationality": [[["American", 57]]], "painter_name": [[["John Cranch", 0]]]}}

He traveled widely as a young man, visiting Europe and the Middle East, where he learned about literature, art, and architecture. During World War I, he was an ambulance driver for American volunteer groups in Paris and Italy, before joining the U.S. Army Medical Corps.\nIn 1920, his first novel, One Man's Initiation: 1917, was published, and in 1925, his novel Manhattan Transfer became a commercial success. His U.S.A. trilogy, which consists of the novels The 42nd Parallel (1930), 1919 (1932), and The Big Money (1936), was ranked by the Modern Library in 1998 as 23rd of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Written in experimental, non-linear form, the trilogy blends elements of biography and news reports to paint a landscape of early 20th-century American culture.\nBeyond his writing, Dos Passos is known for his shift in political views. Following his experiences in World War I, he became interested in socialism and pacifism, which also influenced his early work. In 1928, he traveled to the Soviet Union, curious about its social and political experiment, though he left with mixed impressions. His experiences during the Spanish Civil War led to disillusionment about left-wing politics while also severing his relationship with fellow writer Ernest Hemingway. By the 1950s, his political views had changed dramatically, and he had become more conservative. In the 1960s, he campaigned for presidential candidates Barry Goldwater and Richard M.

He began his artistic studies at the St. Louis School of Art before leaving in 1885; he traveled to Paris, where he enrolled in the Académie Julian. During this time he was accepted at the Paris Salon, showing work there in 1886 and again in 1887. In 1888 he painted Brutality, depicting a workman beating his horse, a common sight in Parisian streets at the time; the painting was shown at the Salon of 1888, and is widely considered his masterpiece. It is currently owned by the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. Patrick also  exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in 1889, where Brutality won a medal, making Patrick among the first Americans so awarded by the French artistic community; some sources denote him as the first American from west of the Mississippi River to be so honored. He returned home to the United States, teaching at the St. Louis School of Art for three years. In 1903 he moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where he took a position at the Kansas City Art Institute. He would remain with that institution for 32 years, rising to become the primary instructor of painting and occupying a prominent role in the local artistic community early in the 20th century.

He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge (1925–1928), first in English and then in Art History, and then trained as a painter at the Slade.  Downton played the violin all his life, was often invited to give performances, and always participated in the fortnight-long Grittleton Summer School of Music in Malvern, Worcestershire. He also wrote books, such as The Death of Art (1937) and Craftsmanship, Art and Criticism (1993). But it is his paintings for which he is now chiefly remembered. He travelled regularly around Europe, and was particularly happy in northern Italy. His main subject was young girlhood, rendered in the manner of the Italian old masters and with the tempera technique that had been revived by the Birmingham Group.\nBoth his subject matter and his techniques were deeply unfashionable during most of his adult life, and he ceased to exhibit after the start of the Second World War, during which he was a conscientious objector, working on the land in Shropshire and Pitlochry, Scotland.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-19790", "doctext": "John Doyle (Dublin 1797 – 2 January 1868 London), known by the pen name H. B., was a political cartoonist, caricaturist, painter and lithographer.\nHe was the eldest son of a Dublin silk mercer, and came from a Roman Catholic family which in the 17th century had been granted extensive estates, possibly in County Offaly or County Laois, and their own coat of arms, but had suffered for their religion and since been dispossessed. In his youth he learned to paint landscapes under Gaspare Gabrielli, and miniature portraits at the Royal Dublin Society's drawing school under John Comerfield. He won a gold medal in 1805. He was commissioned to paint equestrian portraits of the Marquess of Sligo and Lord Talbot, the Irish viceroy, and in 1822 he produced six prints entitled The Life of a Racehorse. That year he moved to London with his wife, Marianna Conan. His painting Turning out the Stag brought him recognition when it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1825.\nMarianna died in 1832, giving birth to their seventh child. Doyle continued to exhibit miniatures until 1835, but by then he was experiencing greater success with his political cartoons, printed using the new reproductive medium of lithography, beginning in 1827. These were issued once a month during parliamentary sessions, and continued for twenty-two years. His caricatures were mostly faithful likenesses of their subjects, with little exaggeration, treated with sarcastic humour, often alluding to popular plays. They were signed with the letters H. B., constructed out of two Js and two Ds, Doyle's own initials. By 1840 he was prosperous enough to afford a fashionable house in Hyde Park, moving in the same circles as David Wilkie, Walter Scott, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, Thomas Macaulay, Thomas Moore and Samuel Rogers – but H. B.'s true identity remained a closely guarded secret until he revealed it in 1843 in a seventeen-page letter to Sir Robert Peel.\nIn the 1840s, at the height of his popularity, indices of H.B.'s prints were published in The Times and by the publisher McLean, but his reputation faded. His later prints were gentle in their humour and drawn in a soft, indistinct style. Thackeray said his cartoons, although clever and witty, were too \"genteel\" to raise more than a gentlemanly smile – \"You will never hear any laughing at 'H. B.'\" When he died in 1868, his obituary in The Art Journal did not appear until three months after his death, and a posthumous sale of his sketches at Christie's in 1882 was cancelled for lack of buyers. However, he is considered a founder of the school of British cartoon satirists represented by John Leech, John Tenniel, and his son Richard Doyle, which established the style made famous by Punch magazine. The British Museum has over 900 of his drawings in its collections.\nHe died at Maida Hill, 2 January 1868, and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. His sons included the illustrator James William Edmund Doyle (1822–1892); the painter, illustrator and cartoonist Richard Doyle (1824–1883); Henry Edward Doyle, (1827–1892) who became director of the National Gallery of Ireland; and the painter Charles Altamont Doyle (1832–1893), through whom he was a grandfather of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the novelist and creator of Sherlock Holmes.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1797", 19]]], "death": [[["1868", 36]]], "nationality": [[["Irish", 716]]], "painter_name": [[["John Doyle", 0]]]}}

{"docid": "Wikipedia-19796", "doctext": "John Durand (active 1765–1782) was a colonial American portraitist. With John Mare, Abraham Delanoy, and Lawrence Kilburn, he was one of a number of portraitists living and working in New York City during the 1760s.\nNothing is known of Durand's origins, training or upbringing, as is often the case with colonial American painters. As he is referred to in two different known sources as \"monsieur Duran\" it has been assumed that he was of French descent. This assumption has been bolstered by the rococo colors used in his paintings, which some sources have taken to suggest that if not born in France he was at least trained there. It appears more likely, however, that he is the same \"John Durand\" that was apprenticed to Charles Catton in London on September 15, 1760, for a seven-year term. Just when Durand emigrated is unknown; he is first recorded in Virginia in 1765, but by 1766 was in New York City, where an entry in the account book of James Beekman records payment to the artist for portraits of the six Beekman children. In 1767 he advertised the opening of a drawing school in New York, on Broad Street. New York remained his base of operations for some years, although signatures on a number of portraits indicate that he returned to Virginia in 1769, 1771, 1775, and 1780. According to his nephew, Robert Sully, he was prolific there; Sully wrote of him that \"He painted an immense number of portraits in Virginia; his works are hard and dry, but appear to have been strong likenesses, with less vulgarity of style than artists of his calibre generally possess.\"  He is known to have traveled to Connecticut twice for work; a 1768 advertisement from the Connecticut Journal survives, and suggests that he planned on a sojourn of at least a few months in the colony. A trip to Bermuda is also known. By 1770 he was in Virginia, working in Williamsburg and later in Petersburg. Durand drops out of sight as an artist after 1775, when he signed and dated a pair of portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Gray Briggs of Dinwiddie County, Virginia. It has been suggested that he remained in Virginia, as the only other references to him after that point are a painting from Virginia dated 1781 and an entry in the Dinwiddie County tax rolls of 1782. It has also been claimed that he was working in Chesterfield County in 1780. One source claims that he returned to England after this point, an assertion which does not appear to be supported anywhere else.Durand has been described as the \"most consistently delightful\" of the painters working in New York during the 1760s. His approach to painting was linear and decorative, and suggests training as a decorative painter. Like many other painters of the era he saw no need to restrict himself to representational painting; a 1770 advertisement from The Virginia Gazette reveals that he would \"paint, gild, and varnish wheel carriages; and put coats of arms, or ciphers upon them.\" While living in New York he described himself as a history painter, but no history paintings by his hand are known. Little is known of his artistic influences, but some scholars have seen in his later work indication that he was familiar with the paintings of John Singleton Copley, as he began more sophisticated attempts at modeling his figures in the mid-1770s. Certain stylistic peculiarities distinguish Durand's work from that of other painters; these include a peculiar splayed display of fingers, in which one or two are lifted and separated from the rest. His female sitters hold a single flower in one hand, frequently near the bosom, and sometimes the flowers are turned on their stems to reveal a star-shaped array of leaves.Durand's earliest surviving works date to his time in New York; they are so assured as to indicate that he had already had ample practice as a portraitist, but no earlier paintings are known to exist. Besides the Beekman family he was known to other prominent families in New York, including the Rays and the Rapaljes; his group portrait of The Rapalje Children, dating to around 1768 and currently in the collection of the New-York Historical Society, is widely adjudged his most successful work. Other surviving portraits include a pendant pair in the National Gallery of Art, a portrait in the Museum of the City of New York, and two unconnected works in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A pair of portraits attributed to Durand were sold by Sotheby's in 2014 for $389,000.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==", "extracts": {"birth": [], "death": [], "nationality": [[["American", 46]]], "painter_name": [[["John Durand", 0]]]}}

He lived and painted in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in the United States.\nAs an artist, Berninger has been described as being \"in the outer ring of the New Hope School\" and a member of \"The Baum Circle,\" the group of artists either taught by, associated with, or directly influenced by Pennsylvania impressionist painter Walter Emerson Baum.Berninger studied under Orlando Gray Wales and Arlington Nelson Lindenmuth, and was a student of Baum's first class in Allentown during the summer of 1926.  In 1932, he became an art instructor at the Kline-Baum Art School.  In 1934, he was one of four Baum students (along with Joseph Gehringer, Walter Mattern and Melville Stark) accepted into the Circulating Picture Club of the Philadelphia Art Alliance.   In 1936, Berninger became the first curator of the Allentown Art Museum (founded by Baum the previous year), and lived with his wife, Mabel, on the museum's second floor until 1956. Mabel Berninger assisted her husband in his role as curator at the museum, and also served as secretary for the Kline-Baum School's Circulating Picture Club, a \"lending library\" for art.In 1939, Berninger was made a partner in Wuchter and Berninger, a jewelry store located on Hamilton Street in center-city Allentown.  To promote his works, Berninger would often place them in the window of his store.  It was here that local publisher and humanitarian Robert Rodale became exposed to Berninger's works.  Many years later, the David E. Rodale Gallery at the Baum School of Art, named for Rodale's son, held the first major exhibition of Berninger's work.In the mid-1950s, Berninger's work appeared on a series of calendars issued by the local newspaper, The Morning Call.  During this time he frequently vacationed in Bar Harbor, Maine, an area which became the subject of many of his seascape paintings.  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, his home - located across the street from Allentown's picturesque West Park (near the intersection of 15th and Turner Streets) - became a frequent meeting place for local artists.\n\nFor forty years, Berninger painted with Karl Buesgen, a local impressionist landscape artist, music teacher and church organist.  The two spent nearly every Saturday visiting and talking, and every Sunday afternoon painting.  This relationship continued until Berninger's death in 1981. Buesgen died later that same year.  Berninger also painted with Baum, Melville Stark and Clarence Dreisbach on a regular basis.\nIn 2004, the David E. Rodale Gallery at the Baum School of Art held an exhibition of the Berninger's work.

He was a child prodigy who, aged eleven, became the youngest student to enter the Royal Academy Schools. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded at his family home in London, at 83 Gower Street (now number 7). Millais became the most famous exponent of the style, his painting Christ in the House of His Parents (1849-50) generating considerable controversy, and he produced a picture that could serve as the embodiment of the historical and naturalist focus of the group, Ophelia, in 1851–52.\nBy the mid-1850s, Millais was moving away from the Pre-Raphaelite style to develop a new form of realism in his art. His later works were enormously successful, making Millais one of the wealthiest artists of his day, but some former admirers including William Morris saw this as a sell-out (Millais notoriously allowed one of his paintings to be used for a sentimental soap advertisement). While these and early 20th-century critics, reading art through the lens of Modernism, viewed much of his later production as wanting, this perspective has changed in recent decades, as his later works have come to be seen in the context of wider changes and advanced tendencies in the broader late nineteenth-century art world, and can now be seen as predictive of the art world of the present.\nMillais's personal life has also played a significant role in his reputation. His wife Effie was formerly married to the critic John Ruskin, who had supported Millais's early work. The annulment of the marriage and her wedding to Millais have sometimes been linked to his change of style, but she became a powerful promoter of his work and they worked in concert to secure commissions and expand their social and intellectual circles.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1829", 74]]], "death": [[["1896", 91]]], "nationality": [], "painter_name": [[["John Everett Millais", 4]]]}}

Leavitt was born to the sea. His Maine family were sailors, as reflected in early photographs showing his seven-year-old sister Syrena and him at the wheel of the Alice S. Wentworth in Lynn, Massachusetts. Leavitt himself was a crew member on several coastal schooners in Maine beginning in 1918 until about 1925, the tail end of the schooner era.Later in life, the boatbuilder and artist began working for the esteemed Mystic Seaport museum, where he  continued painting and writing about his love: the sea and the boats built to withstand it.  At Mystic, Leavitt worked as an assistant curator, applying his knowledge of sailing vessels to the museum's collection.\nHe continued to paint and write, and his watercolor and oil paintings are in the collection of the Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, Massachusetts, and other museum and private collections. Leavitt painted everything from Old Ironsides to  the Gloucester fishing schooner L. A. Dunton.  In 1952 the maritime artist's works were the subject of a one-man show at the William A. Farnsworth Library and Art Museum, Rockland, Maine. Leavitt continued to write about the technical aspects of the shipbuilding industry, including the monograph Shipbuilding in Colonial Connecticut.\nLeavitt's best-known work was Wake of the Coasters, published in 1970 by Wesleyan University Press. Drawing on his work for the Maritime Historical Association of Mystic, Connecticut, Leavitt sketched a biography of the smaller New England coasting schooners in a work now considered a classic among aficionados. On the opening page of his work, Leavitt's elegiac tone towards the noble wind-driven ships of the past was evident. \"The dude cruisers are only maritime ghosts in an atomic world\", Leavitt wrote wistfully of the old schooners.In his works, both on canvas and paper, Leavitt's passion for the old schooners was palpable. \"There was a time when spars and rigging made a commonplace pattern against the Maine sky\", Leavitt wrote in Wake of the Coasters. \"It was in 1938 when the last cargo-carrying schooner was launched in the State of Maine, yet today there seem to be very few who remember when the reaches and thoroughfares swarmed with coasting schooners. Perhaps that is because the sight was so taken for granted.\"Leavitt's books were often the exception in the world of cool rigging-and-spars nautical writing. In Wake, for instance, Leavitt revisited the sinking of the 1928 sinking of the schooner William Booth by its much larger counterpart, the Helen Barnet Gring, an enormous four-masted coasting schooner built in 1919 by Robert L. Bean in Camden, Maine, for the Boston shipping firm of Crowell and Thurlow. The three-masted Booth, according to Leavitt, was cut down and sunk by the Gring. In Leavitt's hands, these arcane tales of the sea were rendered with the passion of Herman Melville.Leavitt published a number of other books, most accompanied by his own artworks of the great coasting schooners. The Charles W. Morgan, published in 1973, delineated the history of the restored Morgan, the last wooden whaling ship, anchored at Mystic Seaport. The work included more than 80 photographs of the restored vessel, documenting the ship's crew at work on the vessel.\nIn an unblinking assessment of the hazards of sea travel, Leavitt noted the number of crew deaths aboard the schooner. \"The late author John F. Leavitt chronicled the life of the vessel\", wrote Leslie Rule in her Ghost in the Mirror, \"referencing archived ship logs to provide much of the information, including many fatalities.\"The papers of John Leavitt from 1966–74, during his time at Mystic as the Seaport's Associate Curator, are collected at the G. W. Blunt White Library at the Mystic Seaport Museum.  The artist, writer and curator's photographs are in the collection of the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York.

He brought designs inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement into Ellison Glassworks. He collaborated with the painter H. H. Emmerson on the 1880 children's book Afternoon Tea, which was generally praised by book reviewers but generated some controversy: artist Kate Greenaway and her supporters viewed it as an inferior imitation of her 1879 picture book Under the Window:  a commercial success that inspired a wave of similar books. Sowerby countered that the illustrations were not imitations of Greenaway's art but merely within the same genre. Afternoon Tea also suffered from printing inconsistencies and colour misalignment, the result of somewhat haphazard assembly by three different engraving firms before publication. Two of Sowerby's later children's books however (At Home and At Home Again, each decorated by Thomas Crane), are regarded as superior; described by librarian scholar Roger Dixon as \"among the loveliest books ever produced.\"Sowerby married Amy Margaret Hewison in 1872.

Born in the Thirteen Colonies, he later migrated to Bermuda, where he died.\nNothing is known of Green's origins; he is first documented in Philadelphia in the late 1750s, when he sat for a portrait drawing by Benjamin West. The source of his early training is unknown, though it is possible that he learned to paint miniatures in Philadelphia, as did West. In September 1774 he traveled to London for further study, and renewed his acquaintance with West at that time. He does not appear to have remained in England long, and was likely back in Bermuda within the year.Green seems to have given up painting when his wife inherited a house from her stepmother; the couple called it Verdmont, as a play of words on his own name. He also turned to civic life; in 1785 he was appointed collector of customs, a position formerly occupied by his father-in-law, and in 1786 he was named a judge on the Court of Vice-Admiralty, serving in that position until his death. In the latter position he was responsible for the disposition of prizes of war seized by privateers, a frequent occurrence as Great Britain was at the time at war with France; many American shipowners lost vessels through his decisions. Consequently, his tenure in this position was widely reviled in the United States, and he was frequently insulted in the mainland press; some of his decisions were overturned in London as well, though he was respected for his fairness by colonial governor George Beckwith.\nDuring the last decade of his life he was also a member of the governor's council under William Browne. Green was also a gentleman farmer at Verdmont, producing eighty bales of cotton one year there.At his death, Green left an estate valued at £286, half of which consisted of three slaves, a cow, and a horse. He and his wife left no descendants, but are honored in the parish church of Smith's Parish with a memorial erected by their nephew, Joseph Packwood. Verdmont passed into the hands of another nephew, Samuel Trott.Fewer than a dozen paintings by Green survive, and most that are known are dated to between about 1775 and 1785. Two are portrait miniatures, including a self-portrait, and most are of members of his family. The portraits passed through the hands of descendants of Samuel Trott before being purchased by Hereward Trott Watlington, who donated them back to the Bermudian government; all are currently kept at Verdmont, which is owned by the Bermuda National Trust and is open to the public. Green is also said to have painted a depiction of Venus Instructing Cupid while in London, but the whereabouts of this painting have been unknown since the 19th century. The West drawing of Green is currently owned by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== References ==", "extracts": {"birth": [], "death": [[["1802", 30]]], "nationality": [[["Bermudian", 2441], ["American", 1228]]], "painter_name": [[["John Green", 0]]]}}

Assessing him at mid-career, New Art Examiner’s Andy Argy wrote \"Himmelfarb’s art is original […] His unabashed immersion in graphic art, emphasizing drawing over painting, has earned him an important place among artists who make drawings into major aesthetic statements.\" Himmelfarb next turned to monumental paintings  that critic Christopher Moore called joyful, luminous, and frenetic pyrotechnical displays. In 2006, he began to devote considerable studio time to sculpture that curator Gregg Hertzlieb described as an expression of the \"human need for play and (our) enduring fascination with metamorphosis and transformation.\"Himmelfarb has an extensive exhibition history, notably at the Terry Dintenfass and Luise Ross galleries (New York), Jean Albano Gallery (Chicago), Chicago Cultural Center, Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, Eskenazi Museum of Art (Indiana University, Bloomington), Brooklyn Museum, and Art Institute of Chicago.

His finest miniatures Royal & Noble painting are at Ham House, Montagu House, Windsor Castle, Amsterdam and in the Pierpont Morgan collection and collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Vertue stated that Hoskins had a son, and Redgrave added that the son painted a portrait of James II in 1686 and was paid £10, 5s. for it, a statement for which there must have been some evidence, although it is not supported by any reference in the State Papers.  there was a portrait painted of an unknown woman that was known to be the work of Sir John Hoskins ,  work As an important early miniature portrait by John who originally trained as an oil painter. His work is datable to about 1615 and shows the still dominant influence of Nicholas Hilliard (1547-1619). The red curtain background is typical for this time, a development of the flat blue background of Elizabethan (later 16th-century) miniatures. Red paint is laid in flat, but the artist then used a wet brush to lift the red paint in strokes, giving the effect of folds in a curtain. Hoskins has also painted the woman's pearl earring using Hilliard's jewelling technique. This involved laying on a raised blob of white lead paint with some shadowing to one side. This was then crowned with a rounded touch of real silver that was burnished with, to quote Hilliard, ‘a pretty little tooth of some ferret or stoat or other wild little beast’.

John Jackson’s mother was Ann Warrener and he had at least one brother, Roger Jackson.\nHowever, John enjoyed the support of Henry Phipps, 1st Earl of Mulgrave (1755–1831), who recommended him to the Earl of Carlisle; as well as that of Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet, who offered him residence at his own home and £50 per year. As a result, Jackson was able to attend the Royal Academy Schools, where he befriended David Wilkie and B. R. Haydon. At Castle Howard, residence of the Earl of Carlisle, he could study and copy from a large collection of paintings. His watercolours were judged to be of uncommon quality.By 1807 Jackson's reputation as a portrait painter had become established, and he made the transition to oils steadily, if not easily, regularly forwarding paintings to Somerset House. After a visit to the Netherlands and Flanders with Edmund Phipps in 1816, he accompanied Sir Francis Chantrey on a trip to Switzerland, Rome, Florence and Venice in 1819. In Rome he was elected to the Academy of St Luke. His portrait of Antonio Canova, painted on this trip, was regarded as outstanding.Jackson was a prolific portraitist, strongly showing the influence of Sir Thomas Lawrence and Henry Raeburn in his work. His sitters included the Duke of Wellington, the explorer Sir John Franklin and some noted Wesleyan ministers.

DeStefano studied at the North Bennett Street Industrial School and earned a scholarship to attend the School of the Museum of Fine Arts but was forced to drop out after two years due to a lack of funds.\nIn 1933, while still a student, DeStefano created a cast bronze bas-relief profile portrait of Franklin Delano Roosevelt that is located in the Roosevelt Room of the White House and is highlighted by tour guides. Former Boston mayors James Michael Curley and John F. Fitzgerald and two local businessmen provided the funds for the bronze and for DeStefano to travel to Washington D.C. to personally present the work to Roosevelt. Many of DeStefano's future subjects were also of a civic nature.\nDuring the Great Depression, DeStefano worked as an art teacher and on projects for the federal Works Projects Administration jobs program. Although his lifelong ambition was to be a professional artist, DeStefano felt that he could not support his family with his artwork. In 1937, DeStefano established a business, DeStefano Studios House of Mannequins, which restored and created mannequins for local department stores. During World War II, DeStefano served in the United States Navy in the South Pacific as a member of the 58th Seabee Battalion.

I now know that I have escaped the insulating influences and the national prejudices of all three countries, and have retained only their qualities — mainly good. \nIn a review of the book, which reveals insights into some famous personalities of the time, the New York Times wrote, \"... his chats about his sitters are delightfully without pretense ... if his portrait turns out a bad one, he mentions it\".The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography said of the book, \n\nFor Philadelphians who have known J. McLure Hamilton as a fellow townsman — even if a somewhat cosmopolitan one who dissembles his love for his native city by very rarely remaining in it for any length of time, much to the regret of his numerous friends — the dictum of Mary Drew, one of the Gladstone family, that 'it is doubtful if there is one individuality more unusual or more interesting than that of the writer himself' will be accepted as final and quite a summing up of his gossipy new book 'Men I Have Painted,' with 48 portraits. ... But, a book which deals with Bismarck, Asquith, Balfour, Manning, Tyndall, Spencer, General Booth, G. F. Watts and George Meredith, selecting a few of the more world-famous names cannot be but fascinating especially in these days of the craze for personality in biography. Here is indeed revealed the man and his manner and his method and the character of a great period in modern life as is set out by human beings who find in this singularly human being, Hamilton, the painter, a true interpreter of manners and of men.\" \nHamilton was a member of  the American Federation of Arts, the Philadelphia Water Color Club, the Pastel Society, the Royal Society of Portrait Painters  and the Senefelder Club, London.

There he was admitted to the Accademia di San Luca, and was associated with some of the leading artists of his generation. He was engaged by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the governor of the Spanish Netherlands, to acquire artworks in Oliver Cromwell's England in 1655. He took up permanent residence in England from 1656, and served as court painter before and after the English Restoration. A convert to Roman Catholicism, he was a favourite of the restored Stuart court, a client of both Charles II and James II, and was a witness to many of the political maneuverings of the era. In the final years of the Stuart monarchy he returned to Rome as part of an embassy to Pope Innocent XI.\nWright is currently rated as one of the leading indigenous British painters of his generation, largely for the distinctive realism in his portraiture. Perhaps due to the unusually cosmopolitan nature of his experience, he was favoured by patrons at the highest level of society in an age in which foreign artists were usually preferred.

Most of his paintings were of the West Penwith peninsula and Tresco in the Isles of Scilly.\nDuring the 1970s John Miller emerged as a cultural figurehead within Cornwall. He became well known as a painter of popular, Monet-like Cornish scenes (many of which were cheaply reproduced as prints for the tourist trade), as an art teacher, a television personality, a patron of local charities and an active supporter of the Church of England. He was also responsible for some high-profile architectural projects including a reordering of the interior of Newlyn Art Gallery.\nAt an advanced stage in his career John Miller’s artistic style underwent a radical change and by the mid-1990s his work (but not always his name) had become known worldwide as a result of the mass production and distribution of cheap posters, prints and cards with reproductions of his distinctive beach paintings: he produced the first of these in what was to become recognised as his trademark style in 1992. The beach scenes had enormous market appeal and have become firmly established as iconic images which - now much imitated - apparently spawned a genre. The paintings themselves, which Miller continued to produce in large numbers until his death in 2002, became highly sought after and were only available through selected London galleries at successive annual exhibitions which usually sold out well before their official opening dates.\nJohn Miller was elected to become a member of the Newlyn Society of Artists in 1961. John Miller, a household name in Cornwall since the mid-1970s, is an artist whose work continues to have an extremely high public profile, both in the UK and internationally. In a 2003 survey (for the periodical 'Art Business Today') of 200 United Kingdom high street gallery owners whose businesses specialised in posters and popular art reproductions, Miller was listed alongside Monet and L.S. Lowry among the ‘top-four’ best-selling landscape artists and fifth - above Van Gogh (7th), Picasso (8th), and Matisse (10th) - in a list of the current ‘top-ten’ best-selling deceased artists in all genres. John Miller’s work is currently (2004-5) the subject of academic investigation by a postgraduate student at the University of Kent, Canterbury, England.\nLondon art dealers Messums, who exhibited Miller's work during his lifetime, now handle the Artist's Estate.

In the 1890s the two men had crafted stained-glass windows entitled 'Sermon on the Mount' (St Paul's Church, Cobbitty) and 'Nativity' (St Jude's, Randwick). Other works included a window at Yanco Agricultural College, produced in 1902 by F. Ashwin & Co. reputedly to Radecki's design, and the chancel window (1903) in St Clement's, Mosman. His first, major independent work was the 'Te Deum' window in Christ Church St Laurence, Sydney, in 1906. Ashwin and Radecki also collaborated on windows in St James's, Forest Lodge, and St John's, Campbelltown.\nFollowing Ashwin's death in 1909, Radecki became chief designer for J. Ashwin & Co, in partnership with Frederick's brother John; he was proprietor of the company from John Ashwin's death in 1920 until 1954. The largest glassmaking establishment in Sydney, with a high reputation, the firm created the chapel windows for St Scholastica's Convent, Glebe, in the early 1930s. Radecki's work included windows in such churches as St John the Evangelist's, Campbelltown, St Patrick's, Kogarah, St Joseph's, Rockdale, St Matthew's, Manly, and Our Lady of Dolours', North Goulburn, Scots Kirk, Hamilton, Newcastle, and the Presbyterian Church, Wollongong.\nA church committee-member during the building in 1928 of St Declan's Catholic Church, Penshurst, Radecki designed, produced and donated the stained-glass windows there, including a memorial window dedicated to his wife, who had died in 1919. On 8 January 1921 at the Church of Christ, Hurstville, Radecki married Sydney-born Jean Hughes (d.1944).\nDuring the 1920s J. Ashwin & Co. produced the stained glass for the impressive, vaulted ceiling of what became the Commonwealth Savings Bank in Martin Place to designs by Radecki. These had an Australian character, illustrating 'the basic sources of wealth': sheep and cattle grazing, agriculture, mining, shipping and building; stockmen, carpenters, gold panning, farming and wharf labourers were shown alongside a typical banking scene. A window for the reading room of the Mitchell Library, signed 'John Radecki, Sydney 1941', depicted the printer William Caxton with the first book printed in English.\nRadecki's strengths were a natural aptitude for figure drawing and composition, an eye for colour, which he used as a compositional device, an outstanding knowledge of his medium and facility with techniques in glass painting. His recreational passion was playing chess. He died on 10 May 1955 in his home at Hurstville, and was buried with Catholic rites in Woronora cemetery. The six daughters and three sons of his first marriage survived him. His daughter Winifred Siedlecky continued the company until the building's owners demolished the premises in Dixon Street in 1961.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1865", 62]]], "death": [[["1955", 76]]], "nationality": [[["Australian", 909]]], "painter_name": [[["John Radecki", 0]]]}}

Weguelin emulated the neo-classical style of Edward Poynter and Lawrence Alma-Tadema, painting subjects inspired by classical antiquity and mythology. He depicted scenes of everyday life in ancient Greece and Rome, as well as mythological subjects, with an emphasis on pastoral scenes. Weguelin also drew on folklore for inspiration, and painted numerous images of nymphs and mermaids. \nAlthough his earliest work was in watercolour, all of Weguelin's important works from 1878 to 1892 were oil paintings. In order to supplement his income, he drew and painted illustrations for several books, most famously Macaulay's Lays of Ancient Rome. His subjects were similar to those of his contemporary, John William Waterhouse, who also specialized in painting the female figure against dramatic backgrounds, but unlike Waterhouse, many of Weguelin's subjects are nude or scantily-clad. Weguelin was particularly noted for his realistic use of light. Beginning in 1893, Weguelin devoted himself almost entirely to watercolour, and became a member of the Royal Watercolour Society. Weguelin's work was exhibited at the Royal Academy and a number of other important London galleries, and was highly regarded during his career.

It was while living adjacent to the Glass House Mountains that he began to show an interest in art. By 1937, he had enrolled in art at the Brisbane Central Technical College and towards the end of that year, he was accepted into classes conducted by Brisbane artist Caroline Barker.In the late 1930s, Rigby began work with a sign-writing company and then with an advertising agency.

He wrote essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, architectural structures and ornamentation.\nThe elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art gave way in time to plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society.\nHe was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century and up to the First World War. After a period of relative decline, his reputation has steadily improved since the 1960s with the publication of numerous academic studies of his work. Today, his ideas and concerns are widely recognised as having anticipated interest in environmentalism, sustainability and craft.\nRuskin first came to widespread attention with the first volume of Modern Painters (1843), an extended essay in defence of the work of J. M. W. Turner in which he argued that the principal role of the artist is \"truth to nature\". From the 1850s, he championed the Pre-Raphaelites, who were influenced by his ideas. His work increasingly focused on social and political issues. Unto This Last (1860, 1862) marked the shift in emphasis. In 1869, Ruskin became the first Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Oxford, where he established the Ruskin School of Drawing. In 1871, he began his monthly \"letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain\", published under the title Fors Clavigera (1871–1884). In the course of this complex and deeply personal work, he developed the principles underlying his ideal society.

There, he befriended fellow pupil Vincent Van Gogh and, in 1886, painted the first oil portrait of the artist, now held at the Van Gogh Museum. That same year, Russell painted with Claude Monet at Belle Île. Russell moved there soon after with his wife, Marianna Russell, one of sculptor Auguste Rodin's favourite models. Henri Matisse visited Russell at Belle Île in the 1890s, and later credited the Australian with introducing him to impressionist techniques and colour theory.\nDespite painting prolifically and maintaining close ties with the European avant-garde, Russell rarely exhibited his works and, having received a large inheritance from his father, showed no interest in making money from art. After his wife died in 1907, Russell, grief-stricken, destroyed hundreds of his paintings. He returned to Sydney in old age where he died in relative obscurity. His cousin, Australian artist Thea Proctor, did much to posthumously promote Russell's art, and by the late 20th-century, a number of biographies and exhibitions had helped to restore his reputation as a significant artist. Today his works are held in major galleries in his home country and in Europe, including the Musée d'Orsay and the Musée Rodin in Paris.While in Europe, Russell maintained correspondence with Australian impressionist painter Tom Roberts, updating him on developments in French impressionism.

Curry was commissioned to create murals for the Kansas State Capitol, and he completed two: Kansas Pastoral, and his most famous and controversial work, Tragic Prelude, which he considered his greatest. Reaction was so negative that the Kansas Legislature passed a measure to keep them, or future works of his, from being hung on the capitol walls.

Born in Norwich, where he lived for most of his life, he was a leading member of the Norwich School of painters, whose paintings of the city are considered to be outstanding in the history of watercolour painting. \nMuch of Thirtle's life was never documented, and only an outline of his business activities, family life and his place as an artist in Norwich is known. He was apprenticed to a London frame maker before returning home to Norwich. There he set up a successful frame-making business, whilst continuing to paint as well as working as a drawing-master, a printseller and a looking glass maker. In 1812 he married Elizabeth Miles, the sister-in-law of the artist John Sell Cotman. He suffered from tuberculosis for much of his life, and his worsening health reduced his artistic output up to his death in 1839. He produced relatively few works: his unpublished manuscript Treatise on Watercolour was probably for his own use, and he exhibited fewer than a 100 paintings. He was a member of the Norwich Society of Artists and for a time its vice-president, but in 1816 he was one of a number of artists who seceded from the Society to form a separate association, which dissolved after only three years. \nThe majority of Thirtle's watercolours are of Norwich and the surrounding Norfolk countryside, many being riverside scenes. His style, which was influenced by Thomas Girtin, Crome and (to a lesser extent) John Sell Cotman, was both technically accomplished and individual. His earlier landscapes were painted with a restricted range of buffs, blues and grey-browns, but he later developed a brilliancy of colour, producing works that included angular block forms. Unhappily, the quality of several of his watercolours has deteriorated, due to the fading of a particular indigo pigment that he used extensively and to great effect.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1777", 22]]], "death": [[["1839", 42]]], "nationality": [], "painter_name": [[["John Thirtle", 0]]]}}

{"docid": "Wikipedia-20220", "doctext": "John Walker (born 1939) is an English painter and printmaker. He has been called \"one of the standout abstract painters of the last 50 years.\"Walker studied in Birmingham at the Moseley School of Art, and later the Birmingham School of Art and Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris. Some of his early work was inspired by abstract expressionism and post-painterly abstraction, and often combined apparently three-dimensional shapes with \"flatter\" elements. These pieces are usually rendered in acrylic paint.\nIn the early 1970s, Walker made a series of large Blackboard Pieces using chalk first exhibited at the opening of Ikon Gallery, in Birmingham Shopping Centre, Birmingham in 1972 and the Juggernaut works which also use dry pigment. From the late 1970s, his work marked allusions to earlier painters, such as Francisco Goya, Édouard Manet and Henri Matisse, either through the quoting of a pictorial motif, or the use of a particular technique.  Also during this time, he began to use oil paint more in his work. His paintings of the 1970s are also notable for what has come to be termed canvas collage – the application of glued-on, separately painted patches of canvas to the main canvas (see the external link below for an example and image).\nAfter spending some time in Australia, Walker got a position at the Victoria College of the Arts in Melbourne. He produced the Oceania series around this time which incorporates elements of native Oceanic art.\nWalker is currently the head of the graduate painting program at Boston University.\nWalker won the 1976 John Moores Painting Prize and was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1985.\nIn September 2010, Walker and five other British artists including Howard Hodgkin, John Hoyland, Ian Stephenson, Patrick Caulfield and R.B. Kitaj were included in an exhibition entitled The Independent Eye: Contemporary British Art From the Collection of Samuel and Gabrielle Lurie, at the Yale Center for British Art.Walker has a 2008 Landscape Painting on display at the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. in the Modern Section.

Bunney demonstrated a strong talent for drawing and draftsmanship from an early age. The young Bunney became a follower of John Ruskin; he studied under Ruskin at the Working Men's College soon after its founding in 1854, and later worked as a clerk for Smith, Elder & Co., Ruskin's publisher. Bunney was able to give up his clerical job and make his living by his art and art teaching by 1859; Ruskin commissioned him to execute a series of drawings in Italy and Switzerland.Bunney married Elizabeth Fallon in 1863. The couple settled in Florence; they would have four children, including the Hampstead Garden Suburb architect, Michael Bunney. Bunney worked for Ruskin's St. George's Company (later the Guild of St George) in northern Italy for the remainder of his life. In his career there, Bunney produced a noteworthy pictorial record of Italy in his era. Ruskin said that Bunney's work was \"so faithful and careful as almost to enable the spectator to imagine himself on the spot.\" Bunney was a friend of many of the Pre-Raphaelites, especially William Holman Hunt.\nFrom 1870 on, Bunney lived and painted in Venice. In 1876 Ruskin commissioned Bunney to paint a picture that included the entire western facade of St. Mark's Basilica; Bunney worked on this project through \"six hundred early-morning sessions\" spaced over six years. (Ruskin was campaigning to prevent a renovation of the west front of St. Mark's, and the painting was part of this effort.) One day during this period, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, no admirer of Ruskin (Whistler had bankrupted himself in an 1878 libel suit against Ruskin), reportedly sneaked up behind Bunney as Bunney worked, to stick a note to his back. The note read, \"I am totally blind.\" Bunney, absorbed in his work, remained oblivious to Whistler's prank. The painting now hangs in the Ruskin Gallery in the Millennium Galleries in Sheffield.\nAfter Bunney's death in 1882, Ruskin started a memorial fund to benefit his widow and children.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1828", 30]]], "death": [[["1882", 50]]], "nationality": [], "painter_name": [[["John Wharlton Bunney", 0]]]}}

Lundh creates his own world of art, where \"clarity is prohibited\" and rhythm is one of the main ingredients.Lundh has developed a technique in which he paints with paperboard instead of brushes. The characteristic features of his painting are the figurative elements in his abstract images, often with mystical surfaces of emptiness. The people in Lundh's paintings are anonymous; more like symbols than individuals, and it is not difficult to see how they connect to the history of abstract expressionism. Observers have said that Jonas Lundh in his painting \"reaches a cubist effect\".Lundh's art is dominated by mysticism. Some of his works have been compared to works by American painter Edward Hopper, as he has managed to concentrate the light and express something of the same loneliness in his paintings.As one of southern Sweden's most active exhibiting painters, Lundh has also worked with installation- and video art, always with musical undertones. His ways of combining the two professions are considered brilliant. He often works with projects that include both music and painting. Lundh Meets Lindgren is a project that started in August 2007, where Lundh and guitarist Tommy Lindgren \"visualize tones, sounds and rhythms in a conversation between two modes of expression\". Together with Örjan Bertilsson and Alf Nilsson, Lundh and Lindgren form the band State of Art, playing modern jazz with elements of Latin, soul and funk.In the 1980s, Jonas Lundh worked as a freelance musician, playing drums and percussion.

Within Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting, he combines the traditional techniques of Early Netherlandish painting with influences of more contemporary Renaissance painting styles.\n\nAn active member and co-deacon of the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp, he is known mostly for his religious works and portraits, some of royalty. He ran a large workshop, with at least five pupils and other assistants, which produced paintings in a variety of styles over his career.  As a skilled technician, his art shows sensitivity to color and a unique solidarity of figures. His style is highly eclectic: he was one of the first to introduce broad world landscapes in the backgrounds of his paintings, sometimes collaborating with Joachim Patinir, which would become a popular technique of sixteenth century northern Renaissance paintings.  Some works reflect the popular style of Antwerp Mannerism, while others are variations on early Netherlandish masters of two or more generations before, or reflect recent Italian painting.Four of his more important paintings have the monogram \"JB\", presumably for Joos van der Beke, rather inconspicuously placed. In three other works a self-portrait is placed among the minor figures.  From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, the name of Joos van Cleve as an artist was lost. Some of the paintings now attributed to Joos van Cleve were, at that time, known as the works of the \"Master of the Death of the Virgin\", after the triptych in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum in Cologne. In 1894 it was discovered that the monogram on the back of the triptych was that of Joos van der Beke, the real name of Joos van Cleve.  His oeuvre was reconstructed in the 1920s and 1930s by Ludwig von Baldass and Max Jakob Friedländer.  Now over 300 works are generally attributed to him or his workshop, which vary considerably in both quality and style.He was the father of Cornelis van Cleve (1520-1567) who also became a painter, and inherited the workshop.

Camacho Lazo (January 5, 1934 – March 30, 2011) was a Cuban painter.Born in Havana in 1934, Camacho left his law studies in 1951 to dedicate himself to painting despite the fact that he never studied art.  By the end of the 1940s, Camacho and his friend, Carlos M. Luis were well versed in contemporary painting.  It was Carlos who introduced him to the paintings of Paul Klee, Joan Miró, Yves Tanguy and Giorgio de Chirico.  In 1953, Camacho travelled to Mexico, where he lived for a year and met his colleague José Luis Cuevas- they both investigated the sources of Mayan culture.  Camacho's first major influence was the Wifredo Lam exhibit at the University of Havana in 1955.  Camacho was also influenced by the paintings of Rufino Tamayo and Francis Bacon.\nHe had two exhibitions in Havana, in 1955 and 1958, before moving to Paris in 1959.  Once in Paris, Camacho immediately adopted Surrealism and in 1960 had a show at Galerie Raymond Cordier.  Camacho met surrealist poet André Breton during an exhibit of works by Toyen in 1961- his meeting with Breton truly tied him to the Surrealist movement.  This exhibit also served as the setting for a 1962 event with the surrealist group, where he created an antireligious tribute to Oscar Panizza that featured aggressive paintings, including L'Immaculée conception des Papes.\nAndré Breton wrote a preface to Camacho's 1964 exhibition at the Galerie Mathias Fels, describing his work as a painting of cruelty.  Camacho's works, with their claw-like forms laden with ossuaries, borrowed their harsh themes from novels by Sade and Bataille.  Camacho discovered esotericism with René Alleau, who exhibited his works in a show titled The Dance of Death, in 1976, at Galerie de Seine, writing, \"It is essentially the Caput mortuum in its application, hence the emblematic importance of the skull in all his paintings.\"\nCamacho was also fascinated with ornithology, which led to two exhibitions: History of Birds, an exhibition of paintings at Galerie Maeght, and an exhibition of his photos at Galerie Mathias Fels.  Many of his paintings are haunted by the ibijau, a bird he observed on a trip to Venezuela.  A visit to Peru inspired his first sand landscapes, which were shown in 1984 at Galerie Albert Loeb, under the title The Philosophy of the Landscape, in a reference to shamanism.  In 2003, the same year as his retrospective at the Maison de l’Amérique latine, Camacho also had an exhibition at Galerie Tessa Hérold titled The Book of Flowers, which presented his new paintings of reinvented flora.\nCamacho's avowal is best captured in his quote, \"Surrealism is, without a doubt, the most important poetic creation of the XX century, because it is a world open to enchantment.  As for the present? A series of works inspired by the magical and hermetic circle of the Shaman, that medicine man ever present in the life of all primitive societies.  As to the future?  A perennial openness to new horizons.\"\nCamacho lived in Paris from 1975 until his death in 2011.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1934", 34]]], "death": [[["2011", 51]]], "nationality": [[["Cuban", 63]]], "painter_name": [[["Jorge Camacho", 0]]]}}

He occasionally designed porcelain and glass for Moser and other Czechoslovak manufacturers and worked on murals and theatrical scenery.\nGassler's career falteres with the coming of Fascism, when Germany introduced the concept of degenerate arts. The German invasion of Czechoslovakia was followed by World War II, in turn followed by Communist occupation.\nIn 1945 Gassler returned to Vienna, where he continued to work, mainly painting portraits, landscapes and flower studies.\nJosef Gassler exhibited in the Salon des Independants, the Wiener Sezession, the Kuenstlerhaus, the Rudolfinum and in private galleries. On his 70th birthday he received the Golden Laurel award from the Wiener Kuenstlerhaus.

He graduated from Academy of Fine Arts in Prague in 1983.\nJosef Žáček's own visual language was based on geometric signs and later figural symbols through which he came to address universal issues of cultural identity and memory as well as wholly concrete phenomena of the contemporary world.\nIn  his work is frequently used principle of a central motif. The same motif appears several times alongside itself, either in paintings arranged next to each other or within the composition of a single picture.\nŽáček’s work stems from a clearly determined content; it reflects social and political contexts. His monumental canvases are usually monochrome compositions.In the late 1980s, before the fall of the Communist regime, he belonged to a group of young artists who were no longer members of the conformist Artists’ Union and wanted to exhibit freely. After efforts lasting considerable time, they succeeded in pushing through the first official gallery whose programme could include any artist. It was then that the U Řečických Youth Gallery in Prague began creating freer conditions; even non-professional artists could be invited there as guest exhibitors – meaning those who had not, for various reasons, been able to get to art college.\nIn January 1989 he had first major exhibition at the Youth Gallery in Prague, which featured canvases in abstraction shapes on the theme of The Gospel of St Matthew.\nIn 1994 Žáček exhibited a series of paintings at the Behémot Gallery in Prague that were inspired by events that had occurred in 1993 in Bad Kleinen.  The series of evocative portraits of wanted members of the Red Army Faction entitled Searching in Lost Space is not a celebration of violent solutions, rather it highlights how society has evolved in an unnatural direction.

In 1798, Barber was appointed to teach drawing at the Free Grammar School on New Street holding classes in his studio on the corner of Edmund Street and Newhall Street. By the mid-1880s he was well established as the town's first drawing master, with an academy training artists on Great Charles Street. His pupils there included David Cox, William Radclyffe and Samuel Lines, who was to form his own academy in Newhall Street in 1807.Barber had five children. His two sons Vincent Barber and Charles Barber both trained as painters in his academy, with Vincent taking over its running after his father's death in 1811. His daughters Maria, Eliza and Ann Matilda also exhibited paintings and taught private students. Ann Matilda was the mother of theologian and Bishop of Durham Joseph Barber Lightfoot.\nCharles and Vincent Barber, with the elder Barber's former pupil Samuel Lines, set up a separate academy of life drawing in 1809, that would eventually evolve into the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists and Birmingham School of Art.\nJoseph Barber's own work consists largely of drawings and watercolours of rustic landscape scenes - including pictures of North Wales, which he was the first of many Birmingham artists to paint. His works feature in the collections of the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. Samuel Lines wrote of him, 'He was a very talented artist of the old school. He drew the figure and painted landscape well. Most of his time was employed in teaching drawing, chiefly in Indian ink and tinted with colours - such was at that time the manner of making watercolour drawings'.", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1757", 15]]], "death": [[["1811", 30]]], "nationality": [[["British", 1558]]], "painter_name": [[["Joseph Barber", 0]]]}}

From 1744–47 or later he worked in Rome, in the atelier of Pierre Subleyras (1699–1749), who was also from the south of France.

His grandfather Georges Parrocel (1540- ca. 1614) (no surviving works) and his father Barthélemy Parrocel (1595–1660) were both painters. One badly restored painting of Bathélemy survives in the church of Saint-Sauveur in Brignoles, France. His brothers Jean Barthélemy Parrocel (1631–1653) (no surviving works) and Louis Parrocel (1634–1694) also became painters. He was soon noticed\nHe was only thirteen years old when his father died in 1660. His elder brother Louis, who was already established as a painter in the Languedoc,  took him under his care and gave him a training as painter. Three years later he ran away from his brother's house to Marseilles. His talent as a painter became soon noticed  and he got a commission for a number of paintings with scenes of the life of Saint Anthony of Padua for the church Saint-Martin. But he only executed two of them. it is also possible that he painted them during his second stay in the Provence.\nHe left for Paris and stayed there for four years, perfecting his skills. He then returned to the Provence and continued his journey to Italy, where he would stay for eight years.\nIn Rome he became the pupil of Jacques Courtois, a famous painter of battle scenes who was also known als \"le Bourguignon\" or \"il Borgognone\". He also studied the works of Salvator Rosa, an unorthodox proto-Romantic painter. Joseph Parrocel worked with him in his workshop and was thoroughly influenced by him, even if he gave his style later a more French touch.\n\nParrocel then started a journey through Italy and finally arrived in Venice. He was planning to settle in this town but after eight brigands had attempted to murder him on the Rialto Bridge, he left Italy in disgust.\nHe settled in Paris in 1675 and earned himself a reputation. He was accepted as an elected member at the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture on 29 February 1676 and he became an academician on 14 November 1676 with his admission piece \"Siege of Maastricht\". In 1703 he became a councillor at the Academy. As a member of the Academy, he would obtain royal commissions. However, Charles Le Brun, who headed the Academy, refused his cooperation in the paintings of scenes of the campaigns of king Louis XIV, designed to become tapestries in the Gobelins manufactory. However the French Secretary of State for War, the Marquis de Louvois recognized the talent of Parrocel and gave him the commission to paint one of the dining halls of Les Invalides in Paris with scenes of conquest by Louis XIV. This was appreciated and led to further prestigious commissions to decorate the Château de Marly and the Palace of Versailles.\n\n When Louvois died in 1691, Mansart became the chief architect of the king. Because Parrocel had not been paid for several paintings, he had obtained a warrant against Mansart, who was arrested in his coach. Through this action, he fell out of favour with Mansart, who sought vengeance for this affront at the first occasion. When Parrocel had finished the painting \"Crossing of the Rhine\" for the Palace of Versailles, Mansart wanted to remove it. However, the king was so pleased with this painting that he ordered it to be placed in the \"Grand Salon du Conseil\" in Versailles.\nDuring his lifetime, Joseph Parrocel participated in only one exhibition, the Salon of 1699, with twelve paintings.  He died, aged 57, in Paris.\nHe is best known for his heroic battle scenes but painted also  landscapes, historical pieces  and religious works, such as \"The temptation of St. Peter in the desert\" (1694). He also produced paintings for the church \"Notre-Dame des Victoires\", the Hôtel de Soubise and the Hôtel de Toulouse, all in Paris. In 1700 he painted \"The Fair at Bezons\", a precursor of  the fêtes galantes of Antoine Watteau. He was also one of the first to paint hunting scenes.\nHis differed from his contemporary academician Adam Frans van der Meulen by being more original and vivid in his execution. He applied broad, nervous layers with dazzling movements, using intense colours.\nDuring his lifetime he produced more than 90 prints engravings, many of which are in the Louvre, Paris. His works are exhibited in many French museums, but also abroad in Hannover and in Quebec (Laval University).\nJoseph Parrocel apprenticed his two sons Jean Joseph (1690–1774), who became a draughtsman and engineer, and Charles (1688–1752), who also became a painter and engraver, his nephews Jacques-Ignace (1667–1722) and Pierre (1670–1739), who both became painters and engravers.\nA number of his paintings are now suggested to be early works of his nephew Jacques-Ignace Parrocel (1667–1722)", "extracts": {"birth": [[["1646", 28]]], "death": [[["1704", 43]]], "nationality": [[["French", 55]]], "painter_name": [[["Joseph Parrocel", 0]]]}}
