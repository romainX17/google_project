At the age of 17, Albert Clark had defined himself as a ‘naïve animal artist’ and was first recorded under the profession on the 1861 census.    \nAt the age of 24, Albert married Ellen Parsons and the couple went on to have 4 children together; one of which being Frederick Albert Clark who, like his predecessors, also went on to be an artist. In 1873 – 5 years after they married - during the birth of the couples 3rd and 4th children, Ellen died. In 1873, having been widowed for 2 years, Albert Clark remarried Harriet Jane Ireland and fathered a further 3 children which included the acclaimed animal artist, William Albert Clark. Once married, the couple moved to Islington allowing Albert to be closer to his father. After 23 years of marriage, Harriet died and Albert was once again a widow.\nAlthough he produced many portraits of cattle and dogs throughout his career, Albert’s speciality – like his father’s – lied in the portraiture of horses. With these paintings being a well known amongst the Clark family, James produced a portrait entitled “The Runaway Horse” which he dedicated to Albert. Similarly, in later years, Albert reproduced his version of his father’s painting under the new title “Breaking Loose” which he in turn dedicated to his son, William.\nHaving been recognised for his ability to paint racehorses, Albert Clark was regularly commissioned to paint such scenes – often with the jockey alongside his steed. Furthermore, with the annual Islington Horse Show held near the artist’s London home, Albert regularly painted portraits of the show’s prize winning animals.\n \nAt the age of 57, 40 years into his career as an animal artist, Albert Clark was reported deaf.

He was a leading proponent of Socialist Realism in the visual arts, and painted Joseph Stalin and other Soviet leaders.\nGerasimov was born on 12 August 1881 in Kozlov (now Michurinsk) in Tambov Governorate. He studied at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture from 1903 to 1915. There he championed traditional realistic representational art against the avant-garde.\nDuring World War I and the Russian Civil War he served in the army. Subsequently he returned to his hometown to become a stage designer, helping to present plays glorifying the Revolution and the Soviet government.\nIn 1925, Gerasimov returned to Moscow and set up a studio, combining techniques of academic realism with an Impressionistic light touch. He favored a style known as heroic realism, which featured images of revolutionary leaders such as Vladimir Lenin as larger-than-life heroes. As Stalin tightened his grip on the country, Gerasimov concentrated on official portraits, such as Stalin and Voroshilov in the Kremlin, for which he won a Stalin Prize in 1941. He produced a large number of heroic portraits of Kliment Voroshilov, to the point that Nikita Khrushchev would later accuse Voroshilov of having spent most of his time in Gerasimov's studio, to the detriment of his responsibilities as People's Commissar of Defense.\nGerasimov's leadership of the Union of Artists of the USSR (replacing his nemesis and ironic namesake Sergey Vasilyevich Gerasimov) and the Soviet Academy of Arts was criticized as heavy-handed. He was at the forefront of the attacks against cosmopolitanism and formalism during the Zhdanovshchina.\nAlthough his flattering portraits of Soviet leaders and his political activities against artists who would not toe his line have gained him a reputation as a political hack, Gerasimov remained a genuine artist.

She is mainly known for a series of small scale female portraits completed between the late 1540s and early 1550s and a few religious compositions.Van Hemessen is often given the distinction of creating the first self-portrait of an artist (of either gender) depicted seated at an easel. This portrait, created in 1548, shows the artist in the early stages of painting a portrait and is now part of the collection of the Kunstmuseum Basel. Other paintings by van Hemessen are in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and in the National Gallery, London.\nA number of obstacles stood in the way of women of her time who wished to become painters. Their training would involve both the dissection of cadavers and the study of the nude male figure while the system of apprenticeship meant that the aspiring artist would need to live with an older artist for 4–5 years, often beginning from the age of 9–15. For these reasons, female artists were extremely rare, and those that did make it through were typically trained by a close relative, in van Hemessen's case, by her father, Jan Sanders van Hemessen.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Catharina van Hemessen", 12]]], "2_birth": [[["1528", 36]]], "3_death": [], "4_nationality": [[["Flemish", 61]]]}}

After an art historian questioned the painting's authenticity, the museum engaged conservator Hubert von Sonnenburg to examine it. His analysis of pigments from the painting showed the presence of processed chalk and the absence of silver traces in the lead paint, both indicating that the materials used were modern. Because the painting had passed through the hands of several intermediaries before being sold to the museum, Goller was not prosecuted. He claimed that he had sold the painting under his own name and that the attribution had been the work of one of the intermediate owners.Michael Hofbauer, a German art historian who specialises in the works of Cranach the Elder, has alleged that Goller has produced up to 55 fake Cranachs. Hofbauer says that a portrait of the emperor Charles V, described and attributed by Christie's Amsterdam saleroom as \"Circle of Lucas Cranach II (Wittenberg 1515-1586 Weimar) Portrait of Charles V oil on panel, transferred onto canvas laid down on panel 54.9 x 49.5 cm.\", was in fact painted by Goller; the painting was withdrawn from the 25 November 2014 sale. Accompanying the painting was a copy of a certificate by Alfred Stange, a German art historian who had apparently examined the painting in the 1950s in Munich.Hofbauer has stated that he attributes to Goller more than 60 paintings presently attributed to various artists, including Cranach, adding that the paintings have certain common features: they are painted on soft gauze or similar, on a base of gesso, which is then affixed to a wooden panel; the palette is limited to a few dull colours; and an analysis of the chemical composition of the pigments in these paintings, such as white lead, shows that the pigments used in the paintings are typical of those that would have been used in the 16th century. However, the hands of the figures are not characteristic of Cranach, and the craquelure evident in the paintings is not the result of aging but has been artificially produced. In addition, Hofbauer says he has in his possession correspondence from Dieter Koepplin of Basel, an expert in the paintings of the Cranachs, stating that Goller had produced forgeries though he did not know the specific paintings.\nThe District Court of Passau and the Baden-Württemberg State Office of Criminal Investigation have begun an investigation into Goller's activities.\n\n\n== References ==", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Christian Goller", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1943", 29]]], "3_death": [[["2017", 48]]], "4_nationality": [[["German", 60]]]}}

He was born in New York City on May 4, 1959, and has received a diagnosis of possible brain damage. He is often referred to as autistic. In 1976, his poetry was used by Robert Wilson for the avant-garde minimalist Philip Glass opera, Einstein on the Beach. Wilson describes his discovery of the then 13-year-old Knowles in the extended notes to the Tomato Records release of Einstein on the Beach:\nIn early 1973 a man ... gave me an audio tape ... I was fascinated. The tape was entitled \"Emily Likes the TV\". On it a young man's voice spoke continuously creating repetitions and variations on phrases about Emily watching the TV. I began to realize that the words flowed to a patterned rhythm whose logic was self-supporting. It was a piece coded much like music. Like a cantata or fugue it worked with conjugations of thoughts repeated in variations...\nWilson cast the teenager Knowles in a number of his productions, including Einstein on the Beach.\nIn 1978, the American poet John Ashbery wrote in the magazine New York of a volume of Knowles's poetry:\nChristopher has the ability to conceive of his works in minute detail before executing them. There is nothing accidental in the typed designs and word lists; they fill their preordained places as accurately as though they had spilled out of a computer. This pure conceptualism, which others have merely approximated using mechanical aids, is one reason that so many young artists have been drawn to Christopher's work.\nEarly in 2013, Knowles presented several of his poems in a reading at Gavin Brown's Enterprise in the West Village which had mounted an exhibition of his paintings. The same year, the Museum of Modern Art acquired several of Knowles' paintings, or rather \"typings\" or \"typed designs\" – pictures created with a typewriter and using colored ink to make patterns from letters and numbers. He starts the pictures with his signature and works his way up and to the left, Knowles said, painting all the reds, then all the blues, and so on, his father, Edward, added. One of his pictures consists only of the words \"John Simon pollute your anger\", inspired by the art critic's dismissive treatment of Robert Wilson (Simon had described Wilson as a charlatan and accused him of exploiting Knowles).\nIn 2015 Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, staged \"Christopher Knowles: In A Word\", a solo exhibition of work spanning Knowles' career.

She championed nuts through the museum, and by creating portraits of a variety of nuts and nutcrackers. She was the daughter of aristocratic Armenian immigrants and studied at the New York school of Applied Design for Women as well as the National Academy of Design. Later in life, she appeared on the shows of Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Jay Leno, Howard Stern and Chevy Chase among others, to promote nuts and the Nut Museum.\nAt the age of seven, her parents divorced. By the age of nine, Tashjian was a concert violinist living with her mother in New York City's Upper West Side.\nTashjian remained unmarried throughout her life. In middle age, Tashjian followed her mother in becoming a Christian Science healer. She also espoused a tongue-in-cheek theory that humans had possibly evolved from nuts. In 1950, Tashjian and her mother moved into a large Gothic Revival mansion in Old Lyme. Upon her father's death in 1958 she learned he had left her nothing. She continued to live alone in her mansion following her mother's death in 1959.Nuts were a lifelong passion. At the New York School of Applied Design for Women and the National Academy of Design, Tashjian created many paintings of nuts and nutcrackers - themes she would continue throughout her life. In 1972, Tashjian founded the Nut Museum in the mansion. The collection contained only twenty nuts, and was composed largely of her own artwork including over one hundred paintings, twenty aluminum sculptures, nut art, nut jewelry and a Nativity scene made completely of nuts. Many specimens were donated by visitors. The Nut Anthem and Nuts Are Beautiful, two songs composed by Tashjian, were performed for all visitors. She hoped to expand the museum into a theme-park larger than Disneyland. Tashjian claimed she did not know the pejorative use of the word \"nut\" until after establishing her museum, but made frequent comments suggesting she wanted to de-stigmatize the word and the people associated with it.In 2002, after falling in to a coma, Tashjian was declared incompetent and a ward of the state. Despite religious beliefs refusing medical treatment, she recovered, but was confined to a nursing home. The contents of the Nut Museum were removed by Christopher B. Steiner, a professor of Art History and Museum Studies at Connecticut College, after he successfully petitioned the Old Lyme Probate Court to recognize the historic and artistic significance of the collection. The mansion was sold to pay her debts. Steiner remained a supporter and advocate for the rest of her life.In 2004, an exhibition of Tashjian's artwork, The Nut Museum: Visionary Art of Elizabeth Tashjian was held at the Lyman Allyn Museum in New London. It was organized by Steiner.In 2005, Tashjian was declared competent. Her house had at this point twice been sold, when she began proceedings to have it returned. The nut trees on the property had all been removed.

She specialized in portraits, and by 1913, she had moved to London for a career as a society portraitist. Among those whose portraits she painted were actresses Gladys Cooper, Marie Löhr, Muriel Beaumont and Irene Vanbrugh, and society individuals, such as Miriam Rothschild as a young girl and Lady Marjorie Duff. In May 1913, an exhibition of her portraits was held in New Bond Street, London, and in March-April 1914, another was held at the Dudley Galleries, Piccadilly. Her exhibitions were reported by several newspapers and society magazines such as Tatler and The Sketch, which published black and white reproductions. Colour reproductions were sold during her exhibitions and as postcards. Reviewers noted that her style had \"grace and simplicity\"; despite the \"over-prettiness\" of her works, it evolved to \"a happy knack of catching likenesses\" and a \"gift of depicting life-like expression\".\nIn 1915 she painted and exhibited portraits of soldiers. During a sitting, she met Major Boyd Alexander Cuninghame (born in Australia in 1871); who had fought in the Boer War and, during WWI,  against the Germans in Rhodesia, in December 1914 and in 1915. He was wounded and sent back to Britain to recuperate. They married on 12 July 1916;   the Tatler had published her photo with the caption \"Miss Elsie Burrell. The well-known artist who is shortly to be married to Major Boyd Cuninghame (late Scots Greys), who has been serving with the Northern Rhodesia Rifles\". As Major Cuninghame had two farms in Makeni (Lusaka, Rhodesia), Elsie followed him to Africa, abandoning her artistic career and watercolour practice. Less than one year later, in March 1917, Major Cunninghame died of typhoid fever in Elisabethville (Congo). Elsie continued to manage both farms successfully, and samples of wheat she had grown won a prize in London.In 1920, Randolf Baker, a British politician, met Elsie in Makeni. They married on 29 June 1920 in Livingstone (Rhodesia). The couple ran the farms and divided their time between Rhodesia and Ranston House, near Blandford Forum in Dorset. Their daughter Selina Baker was born in 1925.

He was also known simply as Giuseppe Dossena.\n\nHe attended the Brera Academy (Milan) and the Scuola del Castello (Milan), where he formed  strong friendships with  Aligi Sassu, Ernesto Treccani, Guttuso, Domenico Cantatore and Umberto Lilloni. At the Scuola del Castello he won a prize for his sculpture works (a trip to Venice), but his attraction toward color made him choose painting as the medium of artistic communication.\nAlthough his tendency toward impressionism was evident from the beginning, the necessity to provide for his family forced him to dedicate only his spare time to this aspect of the arts. He therefore earned his livelihood for many years with the restoration and the decoration of villas and castles, in addition to producing frescoes for the local churches. In the residences of Pirelli, Falck, Borletti, Invernizzi, Necchi, Toscanini, Count Cicogna, Duke  Gallarati Scotti, and Count Castelbarco, Emilio Giuseppe Dossena decorated, restored and painted large panels with mythological and archaic themes and battles. His works were also in the Italian Embassy in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, but were destroyed by air raids during WWII.\nHis passion for artistic expression allowed him to retain his creative integrity, and he became a sought after impressionist, known for the sensibility of his works as much as for the dynamic strokes which characterized them. His first solo exhibit, at the Galleria Gavioli in Milan (1943), was a success with the critics and the public, and all of the paintings were purchased by collectors.\nThe exhibit at the galleria Hoepli in Milan (1964), and the one at the Palazzo dell’Arredamento, in Desio (1967), also achieved a good response, earning a place on the prestigious Enciclopedia dell’Arte (Edizioni SEDA, Milan).\nUntil the mid-1950s, Dossena signed his paintings GDossena (for Giuseppe Dossena), but the signature mutated in E.G.Dossena after that period.\nAfter the artist lost his studio in a fire, he moved in 1968 to Brooklyn, New York, and resided at 54 Cheever Place in Carroll Gardens and was employed by Studio the Berger, restoring works by Renoir, Rembrandt, Picasso and other masters, property of museums and private collections, among which stand out the Metropolitan Museum of New York and the Playboy Club.\nIn New York, the artist temporarily abandoned his impressionist roots, embracing the neo-expressionism, creating shapes more simplified, almost essential, without any schematism or structural restrictions. The shape is almost snatched from nature, in a continued research to contain and interpret the existential essence and express these new inescapable sensations, which the artist feel away from his country.\n\nThe exhibits at the Columbus Citizens Committee (1973) and the Galerie Internationale (1973, 1974) gave unforeseen positive results. Dorothy Hall, art critic of NY Park East magazine, stated: \"These are exuberant works in rich, assertive color, dealing with varied subject matter, both abstract and representational. In either case, there's a feeling of nervous energy bursting forth in the artist's treatment of generously flowered fields, butterflies, still lifes and dancing figures …”Mario Albertazzi, the Il Progresso Italo-Americano art critic, added: \"Brilliant colorist, he brings to his canvas the light of nature and the joy of life. His works…are rich in density and at the same time buoyant, restless and gentle as a delicate caress…\"After eight years he returned to Italy, and devoted his time exclusively to painting. He regained his impressionistic tendencies, although with a more aggressive chromatic handling.\n\nDossena exhibited at the Galleria Treves (Spotorno, 1977), Galleria Il Portichetto ( Stresa, 1978) and the Circolo Ambrosiano Meneghin e Cecca (Milan, 1983). The specialized press covered these events profusely, offering only positive comments. The art critic Mario Portalupi affirmed:  “In truth, his painting process is born out of impressions and the subsequent emotions, which transform reality and regulate the chromatic entities on the canvas…”His friend Enzo Lepore, renowned opera singer, stated:  “Dossena…excels for the luminous harmony of the chromatic contrasts and he distinguishes himself for the expressive purity of his vigorous and original style… His paintings are fresh, palpitating, and rich with a vast conception and spirituality, in a frame of radiant and intensive colors…”Among the many honors he received, in 1985 Dossena was awarded the prestigious Ambrogino d’Oro per l’Arte from the City of Milan and in 1989 a ceramic tile with his signature is placed in the famous Muretto di Alassio.\nDossena was a member of numerous academies and artistic associations, among them the  Accademia Tiberina and the Accademia dei Bronzi. In the last years of his life, the artist, ill and unable to paint, devoted himself to poetry, receiving numerous awards and appearing in a variety of literary anthologies. The exhibit at the Trask Gallery of the National Arts Club of New York, organized in 1998 by the magazine L’Idea of Brooklyn in his memory, beat all the participation records and it was the first one for an Italian artist in such an institution.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Emilio Giuseppe Dossena", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1903", 38]]], "3_death": [[["1987", 55]]], "4_nationality": [[["Italian", 68]]]}}

Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari does not even mention Fiorenzo's name, though he probably refers to him when he says that Cristofano, Perugino's father, sent his son to be the shop drudge of a painter in Perugia, who was not particularly distinguished in his calling, but held the art in great veneration and highly honoured the men who excelled therein. Certain it is that the early works both of Perugino and of Pinturicchio show certain mannerisms which point towards Fiorenzo's influence, if not to his direct teaching.\nThe list of some fifty pictures which modern critics have ascribed to Fiorenzo includes works of such widely varied character that the scholars' suggestions of the masters under whom Fiorenzo is supposed to have studied varies. Pisanello, Verrocchio, Benozzo Gozzoli, Antonio Pollaiuolo, Benedetto Bonfigli, Andrea Mantegna, Francesco Squarcione, Filippo Lippi, Luca Signorelli and Domenico Ghirlandaio have all been mentioned.\nAccording to the 1911 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica:\n\nFiorenzo's authentic works are remarkable for their sense of space and for the expression of that peculiar clear, soft atmosphere which is so marked a feature in the work of Perugino. But Fiorenzo has an intensity of feeling and a power of expressing character which are far removed from the somewhat affected grace of Perugino. Of the forty-five pictures bearing Fiorenzo's name in the Pinacoteca of Perugia, the eight charming St Bernardino panels are so different from his well-authenticated works, so Florentine in conception and movement, that the Perugian's authorship is very questionable.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Fiorenzo di Lorenzo", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1440", 24]]], "3_death": [[["1522", 31]]], "4_nationality": [[["Italian", 44]]]}}

It has been estimated that during his lifetime Brangwyn produced over 12,000 works. His mural commissions would cover over 22,000 sq ft (2,000 m2) of canvas, he painted over 1,000 oils, over 660 mixed media works (watercolours, gouache), over 500 etchings, about 400 wood-engravings and woodcuts, 280 lithographs, 40 architectural and interior designs, 230 designs for items of furniture and 20 stained glass panels and windows. \nBrangwyn received some artistic training, probably from his father, and later from Arthur Heygate Mackmurdo and in the workshops of William Morris, but he was largely an autodidact without a formal artistic education. When, at the age of seventeen, one of his paintings was accepted at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, he was strengthened in his conviction to become an artist. Initially, he painted traditional subjects about the sea and life on the seas. His 1890 canvas, Funeral At Sea won a medal of the third class at the 1891 Paris Salon. The murals for which Brangwyn was famous, and during his lifetime he was very famous indeed, were brightly coloured and crowded with details of plants and animals, although they became flatter and less flamboyant later in his life.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Frank Brangwyn", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1867", 36]]], "3_death": [[["1956", 51]]], "4_nationality": []}}

He was active mainly between 1732–1769. \nTraversi can be described as a Neapolitan Hogarth, Steen or Longhi, working in a Caravaggist style. Traversi's satirical paintings typically depict animated groups of bourgeois protagonists that seem compressed physically into an indoor pictorial space that can barely contain them. Even his religious canvases have foreshortened crowding. Facial expressions are lively and varied; some of the characters, often children, stare at the viewer. Women are often situated in either a foolish or ironic situation, or engage in a pulchritudinous talent, while men leer or participate with other intentions in mind. One could view these as elaborations of moralistic tales, such as Caravaggio's The Fortune Teller, a topic which Traversi also depicted, but Traversi's living rooms are more densely populated, and the emotions, as well as the situations, teeter awkwardly with imbalance.\nAlthough he had no pupils, his influence was significant, and can be seen in the works of Lorenzo de Caro, Giuseppe Bonito and  Orazio Solimena.Traversi was a focus of a monograph by Roberto Longhi.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Gaspare Traversi", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1722", 21]]], "3_death": [[["1770", 39]]], "4_nationality": [[["Italian", 52]]]}}

Ford (20 May 1808 in London – July 1876 in London), was a South African natural history illustrator who joined the British Museum in 1837. He portrayed animals and produced the plates in Sir Andrew Smith's Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa.Ford was the son of an English farmer in the Cape, James Edward Ford, who was himself a talented miniaturist. Capt. James Edward Ford, one of the 1820 Settlers, was born in England in 1770, and emigrated to South Africa, landing at Port Elizabeth in April 1820. The area allocated to the party lay midway between Bathurst and the Great Fish River mouth and was named Cuylerville after Col. Jacob Cuyler. Ford, his wife Frances Stransham, and their seven children were amongst 256 Settlers on the ship Chapman. The children were Frances Jane Ford 14, James Samuel Ford 13, George Henry Ford 11, Edward Stransham Ford 9, Adelaide Elizabeth Ford 8, Jane Murray Ford 6, and John Henry Ford 3.Andrew Smith made the acquaintance of the Ford family in 1821 when he was visiting farmers, urging them to provide him with specimens of interest. Young George Ford was suffering from a broken hip inflicted by a cow, an injury which left him permanently crippled, prompting Smith to take him back to Cape Town. While convalescing there he was encouraged to paint and draw Smith's specimens. He proved to be so proficient that in 1825 Smith recommended him to the newly founded South African Museum in Cape Town, and later seconded him to the 1834–36 \"Expedition for Exploring Central Africa\". A report on this expedition was Illustrations of the zoology of South Africa, consisting chiefly of figures and descriptions of the objects of natural history collected during an expedition into the interior of South Africa, in the years 1834, 1835, and 1836.When Smith returned to England in 1837, Ford accompanied him and soon found recognition for the quality of his work. He was employed at the British Museum and worked there with Smith who was finally driven away by the discomfort of the Bloomsbury semi-basement. Ford continued working under John Edward Gray, assistant to the Keeper of Zoology. Because of chronic backache, Ford eventually worked from the Surbiton home of Albert Günther who was to succeed Gray in 1875.\nGeorge Viner Ellis (1812-1900) succeeded to the Chair of Anatomy at University College London in 1850, and became one of the foremost anatomists of his time. This institution, in its first thirty-five years of existence, published a large number of anatomical atlases. Ellis and Ford used the relatively new technique of chromolithography for their imperial folio atlas of fifty-eight plates, Illustrations of Dissections in a Series of Original Coloured Plates the Size of Life. The plates were done between 1863 and 1867, with from four to seven completed each year. These plates are considered clear and accurate, with an aesthetic depiction of the cadavers, printed by the Mintern Bros., and published by James Walton.Ford married Emma Ethel Ford.

Both his life and his art have been greatly influenced by his intellectual exchanges with Hermann Nitsch, Peter Kubelka, Antonio Gargano, Buz Barclay, Jonas Mekas and Bernard Heidsieck. Likewise, his decade of work in the Historical Archives of the Institute of the Banco of Naples Foundation yielded numerous works, the most important of which is his volume prefaced by Ernst H. Gombrich, The Pleasures of Boredom: Four Centuries of Doodles in the Historical Archives of the Bank of Naples.In 1998 the antique yacht Halloween became his home, laboratory and oratorio, inspiring his poem Prisoner of Freedom, which was translated into Japanese by Moto Hashiramoto. The book was presented at the Twelfth Congress of the Society for the Philosophy of Language (Piano di Sorrento, October 2005) as the first symmetrical book in the tradition of the illustrated poem. In 2003 Zevola created an installation in the Certosa of Padula entitled The Rule and the Exception: The All Too Human Cry of Giordano Bruno Responds to the Contemplative Silence of San Bruno, which is still on view. In 2004 he founded the publishing house Position Plotting Book which publishes in editions of 500 without a copyright the works of various international authors with translations in numerous languages. Recitations of these works have been the occasion for several performances around the world (Kyoto, Tokyo, Vilnius, Vienna, Berlin, Budapest, Paris, Naples, Rome and New York City).

Considered as the \"Grand Maître of Haitian Art\" Hyppolite was born in Saint-Marc, Hyppolite was a third generation Vodou priest, or houngan.  He also made shoes and painted houses before taking up fine art painting, which he did untrained. Hyppolite spent five years outside of Haiti from 1915-1920. His travels abroad included trips to New York and Cuba.  Although he later claimed those years had been spent in Africa, such as Dahomey and Ethiopia, scholars regard that as more likely an instance of promotional myth-making than factual.Hyppolite's talent as an artist was noticed by Philippe Thoby-Marcelin, who brought him to Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince in 1946.  There Hyppolite worked in the studio run by Dewitt Peters, a watercolorist and schoolteacher from the United States who had come to Haiti to teach the English language as part of the Good Neighbor Policy.  In 1944 Peters opened an art center in the capital that provided free materials.  Before arriving at the Centre d'Art Hyppolite had painted upon cardboard using chicken feathers and sold to visiting United States Marines because he owned no brushes.   Peters had first noticed Hyppolite's work in 1943 on the exterior doors of a bar in Montrouis, which Hyppolite had painted with flower and bird designs.  Flowers could represent attributes of deities in Vodou symbolism, and although the doors had not been explicitly religious Hyppolite recognized interest in Vodou among art buyers and incorporated Vodou themes into his work during his time at Peters's studio.André Breton, a leading surrealist, traveled to Haiti in 1945 with Cuban artist Wifredo Lam.  Lam purchased two of Hyppolite's paintings; Breton purchased five paintings and wrote about Hyppolite's work in Surrealism and Painting.  Although Breton included Hyppolite among surrealists, Hyppolite's work was more realistic and religious than an effort to reproduce dream imagery.  Nonetheless, Breton's regard for Hyppolite's work brought Hyppolite and Haitian painting to a wider audience.  In January 1947 Hyppolite exhibited at a UNESCO exhibition in Paris and received an enthusiastic reception.  The United States writer Truman Capote praised Hyppolite's painting \"because there's nothing in it that has been slyly transposed\".Hyppolite, a prolific painter, typically depicted Vodou scenes and created between 250 and 600 paintings during the last three years of his life. Much of his work was influenced by his devotion to his work as a priest. However, after retiring from his work as a houngan, his work reflected the darker aspects of Haitian vodoo. He died at about age 54 in Port-au-Prince.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Hector Hyppolite", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1894", 18]]], "3_death": [[["1948", 23]]], "4_nationality": [[["Haitian", 35]]]}}

After being left at the monastery, he would never again see any family member.  Sert left the monastery, he then became an apprentice to a French painter called René. As soon as he thought he was competent, Sert got parted with his master and tried to earn a living as a professional artist on his own. He was soon seen as a prodigy in the neighborhoods around Montparnasse.\nThough known in France, \"It was Expressen employee Svante Löfgren who discovered (for Sweden) the then 20-year-old painter in Paris, a young genius, a self-immolating young man who lived to paint.\" Löfgren had been initially introduced to Sert by the actor Lars Burman. Löfgren, writing for the Expressen in Paris, stated in his 1958 article on Sert, \"He can become one of the greats of his generation. If he does not starve to death.\" Mr. Löfgren words would come to be almost prophetic. In fact, Sert had become, \"close to starvation. He had written and asked for money, collapsed and was rescued in hospital.\" Löfgren duly reported on these events and \"got some Swedes who were interested in art to act: they wrote Henri Sert in Paris; promised him his own studio and cash in exchange for him working together on an exhibition.\"Sert got help to get to Sweden, and the idea was that he would do a big show. He traveled to Sweden where he had the chance to show his art at different exhibitions in Copenhagen and Oslo. Notable exhibitions included Galleri Danielsson in Borgholm, Galerie Marya in Copenhagen, the Art Association in Oslo and Gallery Danielsson in Borgholm.He first set up in Ven, \"where he borrowed a studio in Emil Johansson-Thor's old farm.\" However, before his exhibition shows could be arranged and presented problems developed. Sert having little money had begun to exchange his paintings for necessities. \"...He did not have enough paintings (for his exhibition), he had exchanged them for clothes, food and new colors (paints).\" Still, the reviews were positive, \"His oils shimmer like mother-of-pearl with myriads of splashes of paint and glazed brushstrokes, sometimes fine-tuned to the smallest detail with plump dot patterns,\" wrote Alvar Jonsson.\" French sensation in the Art Association\" wrote a Danish newspaper after the exhibition 1959 Copenhagen.\" Still, Sert was beginning to develop a problematic reputation. He was \"described by contemporaries as a genius, problem child and as unreliable as the wind.\". Throughout the difficulties his dedication to his art remained constant, \"He painted exclusively at night, he lay on the floor and painted on five or six canvases and listened to music.\" Henri Sert painted intensively. He could sit squatting for long periods of time. The canvas lay on the floor; Henri Sert did not use an easel. “The painting just flowed out of him. It was a constant flow - but still creative. He was not a pondering artist; he was a gift of nature with a creative power.\" Directly stated, the author Ivar Ahlstedt wrote that to Sert \"painting was necessary, living was not very necessary\".\"During the early 1960s, Lena Eile and Henri Sert met in the confusion during the student carnival in Lund. “Henri Sert was a bit of a strange bird,” admits Lena Eile: “a short and well-dressed artist's soul, newly arrived from France.” Eile and Sert would become  betrothed. The couple lived together for a time in Lund and continued their relationship when Sert moved to Stockholm. Eventually, personal problems would begin to harm the relationship. As Eile recalled, “I went along with things until then, but when I noticed all the stuff with drugs and everything else, then I gave up. There were constant disappointments; promises that were not kept; periods that weren’t tolerable. Living like that means a home life is difficult.”Sert's personal issues began to also have an effect on his patrons and gallery owners. According to (Lars) Widding (author), the patrons got tired of the young painter who had such a hard time adapting. In recent years he has painted and starved. Others felt it was not Sert who caused the problems with his patrons but rather the \"patrons, who were to represent his art, exploited and swindled the artist instead.\"On 22 March 1964, Sert was found dead, probably due to an overdose of sleeping pills. \"Lena Eile was not in Sweden when Henri Sert died, but she participated in the memorial exhibition organized at Gummeson's Gallery that year.\" “It was great, but I felt it was hard with these guys there, who pretended to be his patrons, but who took advantage of him.” Author Lars Widding wrote, “Young artist genius died in Stockholm. Why could we not afford to let him live? ”Two memorial exhibitions were held in Stockholm in 1964 and in Copenhagen in 1965.

He served in World War I and his books include 'My War' and 'Letters from Stalingrad'. 'My War', two volumes of pen, ink and wash drawings, published in 1931 by John Lane, is a wordless novel of his wartime experiences. His economy of line has been compared with that of Eric Gill and Keith Vaughan.He visited England in 1929, holding a solo exhibition at the Gieves Gallery in London. In 1936 he moved to Cornwall with Gwynedd Jones-Parry, another painter, whom he married in 1937. One of their wedding presents was Alfred Wallis' 'Three Sailing Vessels on a River' given by Jim Ede, who was a junior curator at the Tate and purchased many of Wallis' paintings.\nThe couple lived at Caunce Head near Mullion, Cornwall on the Lizard Peninsula and stayed there for the rest of their lives. He exhibited with the Newlyn Society of Artists and the Penwith Society of Arts.\nThe mere fact that Mr Campbell Dodgson, the distinguished Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, acts as sponsor to Mr István Szegedi-Szüts, is sufficient guarantee for the merit of the work shown by that young Hungarian artist at the Gieves Gallery in Bond Street. They seem, almost without exception, to be the work of inspired moments, in which the true significance of a scene, a type or movement is revealed to the artist in a flash and transferred to paper with a few vigorous strokes or accents. They are akin to Mr Paul Nash's memorable war drawings in intensity of realisation and simplicity of statement. Mr Szegedi-Szüts does not appear to belong to any particular group. His art bears no marked national characteristics, although it is inspired by profound sympathy with national characteristic life and scenery. His gifts of synthesis and swift notation are akin to Vaszary's, but unlike the older artist he has remained unaffected by Parisian influences.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["István Szegedi-Szüts", 1169]]], "2_birth": [[["1893", 33]]], "3_death": [[["1959", 49]]], "4_nationality": [[["Hungarian", 61]]]}}

The surviving records indicate that he was born around 1380–1390, most likely in Maaseik (then Maaseyck, hence his name), in present-day Belgium. He took employment in the Hague around 1422 when he was already a master painter with workshop assistants, and was employed as painter and valet de chambre with John III the Pitiless, ruler of Holland and Hainaut. After John's death in 1425, he was later appointed as court painter to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, working in Lille until he moved to Bruges in 1429 where he lived until his death. He was highly regarded by Philip and undertook a number of diplomatic visits abroad, including to Lisbon in 1428 to explore the possibility of a marriage contract between the duke and Isabella of Portugal.About 20 surviving paintings are confidently attributed to him, as well as the Ghent Altarpiece and the illuminated miniatures of the Turin-Milan Hours, all dated between 1432 and 1439. Ten are dated and signed with a variation of his motto ALS ICH KAN (As I (Eyck) can), a pun on his name, which he typically painted in Greek characters. \nVan Eyck painted both secular and religious subject matter, including altarpieces, single-panel religious figures and commissioned portraits. His work includes single panels, diptychs, triptychs, and polyptych panels. He was well paid by Philip, who sought that the painter was secure financially and had artistic freedom so that he could paint \"whenever he pleased\". Van Eyck's work comes from the International Gothic style, but he soon eclipsed it, in part through a greater emphasis on naturalism and realism. He achieved a new level of virtuosity through his developments in the use of oil paint.

Davis.\nDavis was born Jane Anthony in Warwick, Rhode Island, the daughter of Giles and Sara Robinson Greene Anthony. For a short while in 1838 she attended the Warren Ladies Seminary in Warren, Rhode Island; it has been posited that she studied drawing and painting at that institution. She married Edward Nelson Davis of Norwich, Connecticut, on February 1, 1841, and lived with him in that town for a time. On January 10, 1842, she gave birth to a child. The family moved to Providence, Rhode Island; there she gave birth to another child, her second, on April 26, 1847. In August 1854 she produced her last portrait, of Luella Hodges. She died of tuberculosis eight months later, and was buried in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence.It was common for women artists of the era to sign their work using only their initials, and Davis was no different in this regard; consequently, it was for many years assumed that she was male. In 1981 collectors Sybil and Arthur Kern identified the artist by name, further confirming their identification with two later reports. She produced miniature portraits, working in watercolor and pencil. Most of her subjects are depicted in three-quarter view, at bust length. Often they are clothed in black. Several characteristics appear in many of her depictions: a ragged part in the hair, bluish coloring of the eyelids, a wide and colored horizontal band below the bust, and negative space between the subject's arms and body. The artist sometimes incorporated flowers into her compositions. Many pieces were signed and dated; some also included the subject's name. Davis is known to have produced over 200 portraits, mostly of residents of the areas in which she lived. Three of her unsigned pieces were at one time attributed to James Ellsworth, and later to Alexander Emmons; three others were attributed to Joseph H. Davis and Eben Davis.An undated portrait by Davis, Lady Seated in a Boston Rocker, is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Another piece, a family portrait, appeared on Antiques Roadshow in 2003, where it was appraised at between $25,000 and $35,000.\n\n\n== References ==", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Jane Anthony Davis", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1821", 33]]], "3_death": [[["1855", 46]]], "4_nationality": [[["American", 59]]]}}

He traveled widely as a young man, visiting Europe and the Middle East, where he learned about literature, art, and architecture. During World War I, he was an ambulance driver for American volunteer groups in Paris and Italy, before joining the U.S. Army Medical Corps.\nIn 1920, his first novel, One Man's Initiation: 1917, was published, and in 1925, his novel Manhattan Transfer became a commercial success. His U.S.A. trilogy, which consists of the novels The 42nd Parallel (1930), 1919 (1932), and The Big Money (1936), was ranked by the Modern Library in 1998 as 23rd of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Written in experimental, non-linear form, the trilogy blends elements of biography and news reports to paint a landscape of early 20th-century American culture.\nBeyond his writing, Dos Passos is known for his shift in political views. Following his experiences in World War I, he became interested in socialism and pacifism, which also influenced his early work. In 1928, he traveled to the Soviet Union, curious about its social and political experiment, though he left with mixed impressions. His experiences during the Spanish Civil War led to disillusionment about left-wing politics while also severing his relationship with fellow writer Ernest Hemingway. By the 1950s, his political views had changed dramatically, and he had become more conservative. In the 1960s, he campaigned for presidential candidates Barry Goldwater and Richard M.

The young Bunney became a follower of John Ruskin; he studied under Ruskin at the Working Men's College soon after its founding in 1854, and later worked as a clerk for Smith, Elder & Co., Ruskin's publisher. Bunney was able to give up his clerical job and make his living by his art and art teaching by 1859; Ruskin commissioned him to execute a series of drawings in Italy and Switzerland.Bunney married Elizabeth Fallon in 1863. The couple settled in Florence; they would have four children, including the Hampstead Garden Suburb architect, Michael Bunney. Bunney worked for Ruskin's St. George's Company (later the Guild of St George) in northern Italy for the remainder of his life. In his career there, Bunney produced a noteworthy pictorial record of Italy in his era. Ruskin said that Bunney's work was \"so faithful and careful as almost to enable the spectator to imagine himself on the spot.\" Bunney was a friend of many of the Pre-Raphaelites, especially William Holman Hunt.\nFrom 1870 on, Bunney lived and painted in Venice.

The note read, \"I am totally blind.\" Bunney, absorbed in his work, remained oblivious to Whistler's prank.

He attended a primary school in his hometown and finished high school in Innsbruck. Having demonstrated artistic talent in his childhood years, Oberbauer's desire was to enroll at the Academy of Fine Arts in the imperial capital Vienna. However, his father insisted that he study engineering. Three years into Oberbauer's education at the University of Graz, his father died and he dropped out.\nOut of financial necessity, Oberbauer offered some of his watercolour paintings depicting the old town part of Graz to the local municipality. Oberbauer's work appealed to the municipality, which encouraged him to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. However, he was again forced to drop out after two years due to financial difficulties. He spent some time working as a teacher and unsuccessfully attempted to continue his studies.In 1889, Oberbauer arrived in Sofia, the capital of the newly liberated Principality of Bulgaria, where he joined the Cadastral Office of the municipality. Oberbauer took an active part in the creation of Sofia's first cadastral map. Afterward he briefly worked at Bulgaria's Construction of State Railways and Harbours Office, though he returned to a municipal job due to layoffs. Oberbauer remained at the Sofia Municipality for the rest of his life.Besides being a municipality official, Oberbauer was actively engaged in art in Bulgaria. Impressed by the ambience of Sofia, he left behind numerous paintings of the newly liberated Bulgarian lands, with their still-oriental features, antique architecture and ancient ruins. Oberbauer's works are accurate depictions of Bulgaria's (and particularly Sofia's) appearance in the early post-Ottoman period, capturing the characteristic features of the age and location. Oberbauer's paintings depict the churches, monasteries, mosques, inns, markets and streets of late-19th-century Bulgaria. 70 of Oberbauer's works depicting the urban landscape of Sofia are part of the future Museum of Sofia's collection, to be exhibited in the Sofia Public Mineral Baths building.A small street in Lozenets, Sofia located in the surroundings of the Sofia Seminary is named Joseph Oberbauer Street in his honour.

He should not be confused with Pietro di Giovanni D'Ambrogio of Siena.\nLo Spagna is known for a number of major works completed in the region, that include the Birth of the Virgin from Spineta in Todi, the Adoration of the Magi of Ferentillo and the Nativity of St Anthony in Perugia. Lo Spagna married Santina Martorelli from one of Spoleto's leading families and here he was nominated Capitano delle Arti dei Pittori e degli Orefici in 1517. He died in 1528, possibly of the plague.\nGiovanni di Pietro completed the decoration of the apse and two chapels of the church of San Giacomo in Spoleto. The records indicate that some thirty inhabitants of the parish contributed payment for the work, which was completed in 1526. The apse vault is frescoed with the Coronation of the Virgin and St James, while after Lo Spagna's death the chapel frescoes were completed by pupils, Dono Doni and Cecco di Bernardino of Assisi. The Madonna and Child in Glory with St Sebastian and St Rocco on the far wall of the church of Campello sul Clitunno was completed by one of his pupils from a preparatory drawing by Lo Spagna. The apse of the church of San Giovanni Battista in the small village of Eggi contains a fresco completed by a hand from Lo Spagna’s studio working from a drawing by the artist. For the church of San Martino, Lo Spagna completed the large altar-piece of Coronation of the Virgin, (1522), which today hangs in the Museo Civico of Trevi. For the church of Madonna delle Lacrime was Lo Spagna to complete the fresco decorations in the chapel dedicated to St Francis (1518). Around 1520 Lo Spagna decorated the first altar to the right of the church of Sant’Agostino in Visso with frescoes, now found in the Collegiata di Santa Maria. Lo Spagna painted a fresco cycle for the parish church of San Michele Arcangelo in Gavelli, a hamlet in the township of Sant'Anatolia di Narco near Perugia. \nThe famous Sposalizio, or Marriage of Joseph and Mary, in the museum at Caen, formerly attributed to Perugino, is now credited to Lo Spagna.

She married Francis Sleeth, and from 1892 to 1899 was resident in San Francisco, where she studied with Douglas Tilden at the Mark Hopkins Art Institute. In Paris she studied with James Abbott McNeill Whistler and at the Académie Julian, and in New York City with Frederick MacMonnies and Emil Carlsen. She began working as an art teacher at the National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C. in 1901, remaining there for over thirty years. During her time in Washington she belonged to a number of local arts organizations; she exhibited with the Society of Washington Artists for the first time in 1910, and was a charter member of the Arts Club of Washington and a member of the Washington Water Color Club. Sometime in the 1920s she first visited Laguna Beach, California, and after marrying inventor T. Spencer Miller in 1931 moved there permanently, living there until her death. At the time of her second marriage she was described as a \"widow\"; her second husband's name is sometimes given as Thomas.

A childhood illness made it impossible to walk without pain and prevented Pohl from entering school until he was 8 years old. To keep him occupied, his parents would give him papers and pencils with which to draw. When 14 years old, Pohl spent his summer caddying at a local golf course. A regular foursome of well-to-do women made an unusual wager—the loser would make their caddy's wish come true. Mrs. Yaeger paid for Pohl’s tuition at the Art Academy of Cincinnati for two years. He spent the next 4 years as a teacher's assistant. He did most of the hands-on teaching given to the art students, and he also taught art to underprivileged kids on Saturdays. Eventually, Pohl received his certificate of art upon the completion of a full standing nude copy of a Rembrandt that hung in the Cincinnati Art Museum.\nWhen World War II broke out, Pohl enlisted in the United States Navy, which sent him to Hawaii and assigned him to paint ships in dry dock. He was injured when a destroyer caught fire, and the explosion knocked him off the second level of a scaffold. Pohl was medically discharged and reluctantly returned to Cincinnati, where he was hired by the Works Progress Administration to supervise other artists. In that capacity, he painted a portrait of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nIn 1946, Pohl got a call from a former teacher and friend, Bill Stamper, who had talked the Board of Directors of the Honolulu Museum of Art into establishing a professional art school. Stamper invited Pohl to come to Hawaii to start the school, where Pohl taught for 35 years. Pohl also taught art at the Kamehameha Schools for 15 years. In 1960, he wrote and illustrated the book, It's Really Nice! published by Little, Brown & Company.\nPohl died December 22, 1999 in Honolulu.

Although it is not known to whom he was apprenticed, he received his artistic training from 1622 to 1628, and entered the guild of St.-Germaine-des-Prés as a master painter on May 23, 1629. His earliest surviving paintings are still lifes. Around 1632–33 he traveled to Italy, where he settled  in Rome. After 1641 he worked in Paris, where he died in 1663.\nMost of his surviving subject pictures are religious works, including numerous small paintings representing the Virgin and Child or the Holy Family. No painted portraits by his hand are known to have survived, although several are known through engravings. None of his works are dated.The divergence of style between Bauguin's still lifes and his religious paintings is, according to the art historian Arnaud Brejon de Lavergnée, \"one of the great paradoxes of seventeenth-century French art: that one and the same artist ... should have produced still-life paintings controlled by a subtly rigorous construction and learned use of rules, as well as religious and mythological subject pictures with an evidently decorative character; compounding the enigma is the fact that the still lifes are signed while the subject paintings are not.\" During the twentieth century, some scholars speculated  that there were two painters with the same name.The four still lifes securely attributed to Baugin—Still life with Apricots, Still life with Candlestick, Still life with Chessboard (also known as The Five Senses), and Still life with Water Wafers—were completed before the artist was twenty years of age. Trevor Winkfield calls Baugin \"one of the most innovative of all French still life painters\", and says the off-balance perspective of the Still life with Chessboard produces a \"topographical alienation\" reminiscent of the metaphysical art of Giorgio de Chirico.In contrast to the precise observation of Baugin's still lifes, his religious and historical paintings are stylized and graceful, showing the influence of Raphael and Parmigianino. He often painted several versions of a composition using different techniques, so that one may be thinly painted in broad, opaque tones while another is painted using enamel-like glazes.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Lubin Baugin", 0]]], "2_birth": [], "3_death": [[["1663", 33]]], "4_nationality": [[["French", 45]]]}}

World War II is a recurring theme in his work. He is a key figure of the generation of European figurative painters who gained renown at a time when many believed the medium had lost its relevance due to the new digital age.\nMuch of Tuymans' work deals with moral complexity, specifically the coexistence of 'good' and 'evil'. His subjects range from major historical events such as the Holocaust to the seemingly inconsequential or banal: wallpaper, Christmas decorations or everyday objects for example.\nThe artist's sparsely-coloured figurative paintings are made up of quick brush strokes of wet paint. Tuymans paints from photographic or cinematic images drawn from the media or public sphere, as well as from his own photographs and drawings. They often appear intentionally out of focus. The blurred effect is, however, created purposefully with painted strokes, it is not the result of a 'wiping away' technique.Formal and conceptual oppositions recur in his work, which is echoed in his remark that while 'sickness should appear in the way the painting is made' there is also pleasure in its making – a 'caressing' of the canvas. This reflects Tuymans' semantic shaping of the philosophical content of his work. Often allegorical, his titles add a further layer of imagery to his work – a layer that exists beyond the visible. The painting Gaskamer (Gas Chamber) exemplifies his use of titles to provoke associations in the mind of the viewer. Meaning, in his work, is never fixed; his paintings incite thought. A related characteristic of Tuymans' work is the way he often works in series, a method which enables one image to generate another through which images can be formulated and reformulated ad infinitum. Images are repeatedly analysed and distilled, and a large number of drawings, photocopies and watercolours are produced in preparation for his oil paintings. Each final painting is, however, completed in a single day.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Luc Tuymans", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1958", 26]]], "3_death": [], "4_nationality": [[["Belgian", 37]]]}}

{"docid": "Wikipedia-23969", "doctext": "László Dombrovszky  (born 7 August 1894 in Orhei, near Kishinev, Bessarabia (Eastern Moldova)) was a painter born as Stanislaw Dombrowski.\nHis father, Sergej Dombrowski, forest engineer, Polish wholesaler, his mother Russian-Jewish Maria Aranov physician. The family moved to Vologda  where Stanislaw spent his childhood. He graduated in Nyiznij Novgorod. His Western oriented parents sent him to Paris, to where finally his mother helped him to save him from the bloody events of the 1917 Revolution. The other members of the family, the parents and the two sisters, including their husbands became victims of the revolution’s insanity.\nStanislaw Dombrowski spent longer time in France, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, and Bulgaria. In his youth it was Paris that opened him the path to become an individual artist. In the French capital among others he became the disciple of Matisse and Othon Friesz  he visited the Julian Academy and was attracted by the École de Paris (School of Paris) international artists’ spirituality that is determinative in the development of the artist’s oeuvre.\nHe settled in Hungary in 1921. He nationalized himself in order to make easier to integrate and living. He changed his name to László Dombrovszky. In 1924 together with István Szőnyi[6] and Róbert Berény he was one of the founders of the Artist Colony in the village of Zebegény. However his French-school training differentiated, separated him from the Post-Nagybánya school. Among the Hungarian artists the paintings of Béla Czóbel and Róbert Berény affected him. These years he sought the balance between the schools of the (École de Paris) and Poszt-Nagybánya.  In the sixtieth his youthfully soaring spirit shows similarities with Braque and Matisse (Henri Matisse).\nIn his old age his art turned gradually into a more abstract direction that is on a basis of musical effects.  At the same time, in their spirit the youthfully soaring works that Dombrovszky painted in the 1960s show – at one remove anyway – a relationship with Braque and Matisse, who matured from a once-time Fauve youngster into a classical master. Matisse, too, had in the early 20th century a private school that was frequented by young artists from Central and Eastern Europe. In his old age his art turned step by step to a more abstract direction based on musical effects.\n‘His more individual style developed from the 1950s onwards,’ said Lajos Németh ‘in his art, structure became strong; he transcribed motifs in a more decorative manner, for instance with many arabesque-like elements. The contour lines played a linking role. The vital element in his art was rhythm, namely the rhythm of colours and lines, and the composition of his pictures was based on these main traits. He consciously endeavoured to obtain musical effects; many of his pictures could have borne the title ‘Improvisation’, also in the musical sense of the word.’ In fact, he played the violin and piano wonderfully; as relaxation, he was able to improvise music for hours. In 1969 with an interview given to Aliz Torday he said the following that can be considered as his ars poetica. He was an artist of few words: ‘For me art is not a logical or speculative world,’ he once declared ‘but is emotional, like poetry. The truth of the artwork is different from everyday truth. At the same time truth – authenticity, in the sense of similitude – is not important. Every work of art has its own laws. The condition for creation is, however, always humane: it comes from a ‘pure wellspring’. He then quotes the classical concept: ‘The picture is always a complete whole.’ One must never take out one part and look at it separately. It is like an orchestral work, in which one does not listen to the instruments separately, but together, and only in this way do they produce the desired effect ... There is no life without music and colour, as the sound and colour are one of the appearing forms of the existence.\"\nDuring the Nazi occupation of Hungary he saved human lives. He had close contact with Vilmos Forgács, one of Raoul Wallenberg’s staff members who got Dombrovszky acquainted with the Swedish diplomat. So this is how it happened among others the portrait of Wallenberg was painted. Raoul Wallenberg sat himself as a model in September 1944, Budapest. It is the only known authentic existing piece of art of Raoul Wallenberg. Wallenberg posed only three times for his portrait (this is known from his diary kept by the Soviets after his death later on given back to Wallenberg’s family), so Dombrovszky could not finish it as Wallenberg was abducted by the Soviets, January 1945. Today the portrait is preserved in Gripsholm Castle near Stockholm (Statens Porträttsamling på Gripsholm, presenting important personalities from the Swedish history). The portrait is presented at the permanent exhibition United States Holocaust Memorial Museum: http://wallenberg-dombrovszky.com/portre-kep/en\nLászló Dombrovszky died in Budapest, 30 April 1982. His pictures can be found in Hungary, France, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden (Statens Porträttsamling på Gripsholm), in Italy, etc. both in private and public collections.\nDuring one period, between the two World Wars, he earned a living from painting portraits, primarily in Italy; the majority of these pictures as well as the works that remained in his atelier in Paris were, regrettably, lost after 1945: no traces of them could be found. From time to time his works come to light at auctions or in consequence of an unexpected event.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["László Dombrovszky", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1894", 35]]], "3_death": [[["1982", 4985]]], "4_nationality": [[["Hungarian", 1472]]]}}

He was a passionate colourist and researched all the nuances of colour. He studied techniques from ancient Greece and the Renaissance, including Titian, Veronese and Correggio. Impressed by Rubens' research into colour, he considered his as the Shakespeare of painting and was greatly inspired by him. Very early in his career Riesener studied tonal divisions, well before the physician Chevreul discovered their scientific basis. His tactile taste led him to look for the most perfect expression of matter and particularly of skin. He put poetry into his painting by the play of shadow and he passionately admired nature, life and all the beauties they produced.\nHe researched the subject of life in the countryside and, liking to paint reality, said he wanted to express \"the heat of the day, the melancholy of the evening, meadows, flowers as they are in nature\". His study of the elements caused him to paint a series of skies which varied according to the light and time of day – the subjects were ahead of their time and Riesener had to fight hard against the Salon juries and the Institut. Using pure colours, he excluded the blacks and whites which had been used for shadows and light before him. His material science of colour was the opposition which gave birth to contrasts from juxtaposed pigments.

His works are dated to circa 630 BC. Two of his vases were discovered in Aegina. Since the 19th century, those pieces were on display in Berlin, but they disappeared or were destroyed during the Second World War.\nThe artist is considered one of the best representatives of Protoattic vase painting. Following ancient tradition, he executed the faces of his figures as silhouette drawings. Their clothing, as well as decorative rosettes were applied in red and white paint. He used orientalising zigzag patterns and rosettes. On some of his vases, instead of using the conventional silhouette technique, he applied white paint directly onto a black slip  base. His ornamentation is uniform and resembles contemporary Corinthian vases. His activity probably ceased by 620 BC, as no further vases by him are known. Although he is generally considered a pioneer, the breakthrough of the black-figure technique in Athens was probably achieved only by his successors.\nThe human figures by the Painter of Berlin A 34 are within the pre-black figure (Geometric and orientalising) vase-painting traditions, but his animals are strongly influenced by contemporary works from Corinth, although they appear more stiff and strict.

He and his family (Margo and eventually, seven children) traveled back to the South Pacific to live for years in places such as: Guam (1952–55), Oahu (1956–58), Maui (1964–65), and the Big Island of Hawaii (1968-1971). Often, from there, he would travel to other island paradises: Palau, Fiji, Tahiti, Samoa, and the Solomon Islands over his thirty-year career. He is best known for his nude and semi-nude paintings of women of the Pacific islands. Most of his first works were sensual island wahines in island beach and jungle settings. He painted primarily with oils on board but also occasionally on canvas and with pastels. To add depth and texture, he switched in mid-career (1960) to painting with oils on fine, French silk, black velvet. This was in the midst of the 1960s' Tiki revolution and many of his nude pieces would be displayed in Tiki bars and restaurants. In the 1970s, he started painting endangered animals to call attention to their limited numbers.  Burke Tyree died at age 57 of a heart attack at his home in Crows Landing, California.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-30355", "doctext": "Ray Harm (November 9, 1926 – April 9, 2015) was an American artist, best known for his paintings of wildlife, primarily birds. He was also well known for art marketing and is generally credited as the co-creator of the limited edition art print market, which supplanted the traditional method where artists sold original works on an individual basis. Limited edition art prints are now the standard method of marketing paintings and similar works to the general public.\nHarm was born Ray Auvil in Randolph County, West Virginia; his father was a concert violinist who also was a woodsman and herbalist. His name was changed to Harm after his parents divorced and his mother remarried to William Harm.  He left  West Virginia in his mid teens to become a cowboy in the American West, eventually competing on the rodeo circuit and also training horses for the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus.\nHis service in the United States Navy during World War II allowed him to take advantage of the GI Bill for continuing education. Harm used the opportunity to enroll in art school and afterwards became a painter. While selling individual paintings, Harm worked in construction and horse training to make ends meet.\nIn 1961 Harm's work attracted the attention of Wood Hannah, a businessman and art collector from Louisville, Kentucky. The two men came up with the idea of making high-quality art prints of Harm's paintings, which would be issued in limited print runs. The idea was a great success and gave birth to a marketing method for art that has brought commercial and financial success to thousands of artists.\nIn 1963, he was appointed the first H. L. Donovan Artist-in-residence at the University of Kentucky.\nHarm later wrote a weekly nature column for The Louisville Times, and was a popular speaker and lecturer. Harm was a frequent guest on the radio call-in show Metz Here, hosted for many years by Milton Metz on Louisville's WHAS-AM.\nIn his later life, Harm became a sharp critic of artists who copy their works from photographs by tracing directly over them or projecting an image onto a canvas and then tracing. This practice is now widespread throughout the limited-edition art industry. Harm has prided himself on basing his paintings on his own sketches taken from direct observations of wildlife. On occasion, Harm says he has used museum models of wildlife to get certain details correct, but otherwise his paintings come directly from his own work.\nHarm closed production of prints from his major collection in the late 1990s, with 195 pieces in the collection. He continued to do occasional works as fundraisers for various organizations. Harm and his wife, Cathy, eventually left Kentucky and settled on a ranch in Arizona, where he continued to work. His son, Ray Harm Jr. (better known as \"Hap\"), lives in Kentucky and sells prints from original works by his father that were not a part of the original major collection.\nAn archive of Harm's signed prints, newspaper clippings, field notes, black and white photographs, exhibition catalogs, gallery announcements and 53 pieces of original correspondence is housed at the Filson Historical Society in Louisville.

{"docid": "Wikipedia-30424", "doctext": "The Reed Painter (fl. 420s–410s BC) is an anonymous Greek vase painter of white-ground lekythoi, a type of vessel for containing oil often left as grave offerings. Works are attributed to either the \"Reed Painter\" or his atelier.\nThe vessels of the Reed Painter are typical of white-ground lekythoi in that they often focus on real people, in contrast to the earlier black-figure tradition that featured scenes of mythical figures pertaining to Dionysiac cult. The purpose of the lekythos is often reflected in its subject matter. This artist's most common theme is a scene depicting a visit to a tomb. The figures, usually a woman bringing offerings or a youth leaning on a spear, display quiet dignity rather than emotion. The tomb, topped by a pediment, provides important evidence for funerary monuments in Attica at the time. The artist takes his name from his characteristic use of reeds in the landscape, particularly in depictions of Charon, the ferryman of the dead in Greek mythology.A lekythos by the Reed Painter is one of only a few white-figure examples that depict a horseman at a tomb; unusually, the youth sits at the tomb with his horse rather than riding it. He may be an ephebe in training for the cavalry, as he wears the black cloak (chlamys) that was characteristic attire for the Athenian ephebe at certain processions and festivals. He also wears a helmet in the shape of the petasos, a hat typically worn by travelers, the metal version of which appears on Athenian reliefs and is known from archaeology. He carries two hunting spears, and not the kamax, the long thin spear principally used by Greek cavalry.Around the turn of the 21st century a number of the artist's lekythoi were discovered in a mass burial of plague victims in Athens. Work from the atelier of the Reed Painter is concentrated in Attica, though a few examples have been found as exports to Gela and Corinth.The Reed Painter worked in true white-ground technique, in which polychrome figures are outlined on the white ground, first in a dilute brown glaze and then in a more-fluid matt black or red. Women's skin was painted white on white, with solid colors on garments. The colors — including bright red, yellow, purple, blue, and green — were added after firing. The unstable pigments have flaked away and often left figures on surviving vases with the appearance of nudity when they were intended to be clothed.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Reed Painter", 4]]], "2_birth": [], "3_death": [], "4_nationality": [[["Greek", 52]]]}}

After performing poorly in school and being forced to leave the famed Piaristengymnasium in Vienna as a result of \"disciplinary difficulties,\" his financially stable parents provided him with private tutors. In 1898, at the age of fifteen, Gerstl was accepted into the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where he studied under the notoriously opinionated and difficult Christian Griepenkerl.

Her first cousin was the painter Ellen Emmet Rand.Sherwood may have received her earliest training in art from her mother; a sketchbook dating to 1873 was in the hands of family members in 1987. Rosina traveled to Europe in 1876–1877, and was presented to Queen Victoria during the trip.  Returning to New York, she and her friend Dora Wheeler began study with William Merritt Chase, and by 1881 she took studio space in the Tenth Street Studio Building. Among her earliest works were illustrations for publications such as Harper's Magazine, and in 1880 she won the $1,000 first prize in a competition to design a Christmas card for Louis Prang & Company. Sherwood and Wheeler worked together in the design firm Associated Artists, run by Candace Wheeler, Dora's mother; they designed tapestries, curtains, and wallpaper. Subjects included a variety drawn from American literature.\nIn 1884–1885 the women attended classes at the Académie Julian in Paris; Sherwood's instructor there was Tony Robert-Fleury.Rosina married, in 1887, Arthur Sherwood, having five children with him, including future Pulitzer Prize winner Robert E. Sherwood.

His works number less than 100 and were often executed over decades, as he constantly refined his compositions with new colours until satisfied with the result.

Newell exhibited infrequently and sold very few of his paintings during his lifetime.  However, his works are in notable public and private collections such as the Solomon R.

After an apprenticeship as an enamel painter at a Pforzheim factory he attended  the School of Arts and Crafts in Stuttgart. He subsequently studied under Hans Thoma and Wilhelm Trübner at the Academy in Karlsruhe. Called for military service in World War I, he carried out a hunger strike to secure early release, and in 1919 he moved to Berlin where he joined the Communist Party of Germany and the \"November\" group. He took part in a  Dada fair in 1920 and also worked as an illustrator for several periodicals. \nA major work from this period is his Dada Roof Studio, a watercolor showing an assortment of figures on an urban rooftop. Around a table sit a woman and two men in top hats. One of the men has a prosthetic hand and the other, also missing a hand, appears on closer scrutiny to be mannequin. Two other figures in gas masks may also be mannequins. A child holds a pail and a woman wearing high button shoes (for which Schlichter displayed a marked fetish) stands on a pedestal, gesturing inexplicably.\nIn 1925 Schlichter participated in the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" exhibit at the Mannheim Kunsthalle. His work from this period is realistic, a good example being the Portrait of Margot (1924) now in the Berlin Märkisches Museum.

Often characterised by extreme duration (some performances have lasted 3 weeks) or brevity (some performances just 17 minutes), his works incorporate the installation of ancient and organic items, with the making of gigantic paintings, often illuminated by ultraviolet lighting. These works strongly reflect prehistoric or apocalyptic imagery.\nCaton's work evolved through the 1980s gradually forming the ritualistic hallmark that he has come to be recognised and associated with. His work is deeply informed by a study of Ice Age cave art and portable art, and in 2007/2008 he visited many of the painted caves in the Dordogne region of France. Caton studied at Winchester School of Art and Goldsmith's London, and became interest in experimenting with living art and the human body. His work is emotional and operates on many levels employing specially created soundtracks (composed in collaboration with sound artists brownsierra), altered lighting conditions, use of shadow play with puppetry, live action and sculptural installation.\nHe has also used smell as an intrinsic aspect of his performances to evoke a primordial atmosphere. The performances shares an affinity with the activities and cosmological work of shamans, the complex symbolism of alchemy, and a knowledge of prehistoric art. In many ways, it is evocative of the concept of the wunderkammer or the 17th century Cabinet of Curiosities – it frequently uses paradox. A typical performance may last up to 7 hours, during which time Caton creates hundreds of automatic drawings, which are often obliterated and turned into new images.\nCaton has amassed a considerable array of props that he animates in his performances, such as: huge stuffed fish heads, petrified tree fungi, lead and pewter medieval toys/pilgrim's badges, ceramic shards, fossils, bones, masks, ancient dolls, Victorian photographs. His performances are recognisable by their obsessive use of multi-layering and vivid colours – whereas, his paintings are often in a muted palette of browns, blues, greys and blacks. Recently he made hundreds of minuscule drawings that could only be viewed with a magnifying lens in ultraviolet light.", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Shaun Caton", 0]]], "2_birth": [], "3_death": [], "4_nationality": [[["British", 17]]]}}

After attending school in West Sussex and Kent, she taught English in Argentina after the death of her father in 1930. In 1935 she moved to England to stay with her sisters. Marrying Hal Foote, they moved to Mexico City in 1936 where she studied painting and drawing with Angelina Beloff, the first wife of Diego Rivera. Here, during the period of the Mexican art renaissance, she met José Clemente Orozco who admired her work and advised her: throw away your art books – just work. In 1938 they moved to Guatemala City; her marriage ended after 5 years and in 1940 she met archaeologist explorer Giles Healey whom she married in 1943, settling in Los Angeles before a further filming trip to Mexico. Encouraged by sculptor Henry Moore in New York in 1946, they moved westwards to Pacific Palisades and in 1947 she studied with both Rico Lebrun and William Brice in Los Angeles.

Her work has been widely reviewed and resides in numerous private, university and corporate collections. Sensemann is known as a versatile and prolific creator, whose ideas have led her to explore diverse painting materials, media (drawing, photography, collage, performance), subject matter (architectural, botanical, biological and organic forms, self-portraiture), and styles from abstraction to realism. Critics note her work's densely packed compositions, shallow fields of oscillating space, complex tactile surfaces, and sensuous color and linearity. James Yood wrote that Sensemann's abstract paintings were \"fraught with meaning, charged with value, and seething with import\" in their spiritual seeking. Art historian Leisa Rundquist described her photomontage self-portraits as \"strangely sensual, yet disturbing\" images drawn from \"the depths of the unconscious.\"In addition to her art career, Sensemann was an art professor and administrator for over three decades, most notably at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the grassroots women's cooperative Artemisia Gallery.

She is most recognised for her batik work, and is one of the most well-known batik artists in Australia. Her works also include acrylic paintings, weaving, ceramics, wood carving and printmaking. Most of Tapaya's paintings depict places and events from her family's dreaming stories. Her batik work is of the classic Ernabella style, which eschews the Indonesian use of repeated block printed designs in favour of hand-drawn freehand designs or \"walka\". These \"walka\" are pure design and do not refer to, or contain reference to, dreamings or \"tjukurpa\".\nTapaya is a member of the Pitjantjatjara people. She was born in the desert in the far northwest of South Australia. Her mother had walked from Walytjitjata, in the Northern Territory, and arrived at Ernabella Mission shortly after Tapaya's birth. Ernabella was run by missionaries at the time, and Tjunkaya grew up there. The craft room at Ernabella Mission was established in 1948 and nurtured the artistic talents of Tapaya and other children and adults living on the Mission. The craft room taught spinning and weaving originally but later added batik and painting to its activities, and later still became a professionally run Aboriginal-owned incorporated arts enterprise known as Ernabella Arts, after the Mission was closed and the land returned to its traditional Pitjantjatjara owners.\nLike most early artists in her community, Tjunkaya's original style came from milpatjunanyi – an ancient Western Desert practice of drawing in the sand to tell stories to children. This is the basis of the classic Ernabella \"walka\".\nErnabella women began to be taught batik making in 1971. In 1974, Ernabella Arts sent Tapaya to Yogyakarta with several other Pitjantjatjara women to learn more about making batik from Indonesian artists.Tapaya's work has been shown in several exhibitions in Australia, Europe, North America and Southeast Asia. Tapaya has work in the National Gallery of Victoria, the State Library of South Australia, the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Museum of Australia, and the British Museum.On 8 June 2020, in the 2020 Queen's Birthday Honours, Tapaya was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in recognition of her service to Indigenous visual arts and the community.\n\n\n== References ==", "extracts": {"1_painter_name": [[["Tjunkaya Tapaya", 0]]], "2_birth": [[["1947", 23]]], "3_death": [], "4_nationality": [[["Australian", 46]]]}}

Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age. What he called his prophetic works were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form \"what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language\". His visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him \"far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced\". In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. While he lived in London his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham, he produced a diverse and symbolically rich œuvre, which embraced the imagination as \"the body of God\" or \"human existence itself\".Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as \"Pre-Romantic\". A committed Christian who was hostile to the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and American revolutions.  Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers such as Emanuel Swedenborg. Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake's work makes him difficult to classify.
