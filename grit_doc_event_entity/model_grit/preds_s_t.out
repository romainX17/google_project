' ro ##up ##ell was the daughter of rev . john dry ##den pig ##go ##tt , rector and squire of ed ##gm ##ond , and married thomas boone ro ##up ##ell , an east india company official , on 16 september 1840 . in 1843 , shortly after the birth of her eldest son , her husband was posted to the cape for a period of service leave and she chose to accompany him . during her two - year stay in south africa ro ##up ##ell painted local flowers . a visitor to the cape , nathaniel wall ##ich , who was at that time in charge of the calcutta botanical garden , and a guest at the same cape town hotel as the ro ##up ##ell ##s , was struck by the quality of her work . wall ##ich accompanied ro ##up ##ell on collecting trips to the cape countryside , and introduced her family to his friends thomas mac ##lea ##r , the cape astronomer royal , and his wife mary , leading to a lasting friendship between the women . among the others ro ##up ##ell befriended were baron von ludwig , planner and developer of the botanical garden in cape town , and the ke ##w plant collector , james bowie . the ro ##up ##ell ##s returned to madras in 1845 where arab ##ella ro ##up ##ell continued her botanical painting . when wall ##ich retired to london from calcutta in 1846 , he persuaded her to allow him to take along some of her paintings to show to sir william jackson hooker . hooker was delighted with her work and with arab ##ella ' s botanist brother - in - law , george ro ##up ##ell , chose ten of the plates for publication . having received the blessing of both hooker and wall ##ich , the plates were handed to the eminent victorian lit ##hog ##raph ##er , paul ga ##uc ##i , who prepared the illustrations for the printer w . nico ##l of the shakespeare press on pal ##l mall . the descriptive text accompanying the plates was provided by william henry harvey , the irish botanist . one hundred subscribers were listed , a large portion being from the peerage , and not counting victoria , prince albert and the directors of the east india company . the book was well received not only in england , but also on the continent , where the author was elected a member of the reg ##ensburg society of arts . the work is dedicated to wall ##ich in recognition of his ' flat ##tering encouragement and scientific guidance ' with ' every feeling of grateful and affection ##ate esteem . ' it is thought that only 110 copies of the atlas f ##olio were printed , making the work rare , expensive and highly desirable to collectors . the east india company was dissolved in 1858 whereupon the ro ##up ##ell ##s retired to lo ##dda ##r court near reading in berkshire . by this time the family was financially secure , thomas having been promoted to sessions judge while in india , and posted first to co ##im ##bat ##ore and later to cu ##dda ##lore . ro ##up ##ell took up landscape gardening and spent part of each year at sun ##dor ##ne castle , her father ' s inheritance in shropshire . the hundred or so plates that had not been published were located in the 1930s through elizabeth chu ##te ro ##up ##ell , the widow of norton a ##yl ##mer ro ##up ##ell , and daughter - in - law of the artist . they had passed into the possession of george ro ##up ##ell , a grandson of the artist and nephew of elizabeth chu ##te ro ##up ##ell . repeated letters from his aunt and from pretoria went una ##ns ##wer ##ed by george and the matter seemed to have got nowhere . in a surprising development , a package arrived in irene from england for general jan sm ##uts during his final illness . the parcel remained uno ##pen ##ed until after sm ##uts ' death in 1950 when it was passed on to ill ##ty ##d pole - evans , who in 1930 had accompanied john hutchinson and jan sm ##uts on a two - month bot ##ani ##sing expedition through southern and northern rhodesia to ny ##asa ##land and lake tang ##any ##ika . pole evans passed the paintings on to mary gunn , librarian at the botanical research institute , who immediately recognised them as the long sought - after collection . after being displayed at an exhibition held at the johannesburg public library in november 1951 , the sm ##uts family presented the paintings to the university of cape town , which passed them on to the library of the bo ##lus herb ##arium . eleven of the plates from this collection were published under the title ' more cape flowers by a lady ' in 1964 , while the same plates , with the addition of two more and biographical material , appeared under the title ' arab ##ella ro ##up ##ell ' in 1975 . a painting of a cape erica , which had been given to lady d ' urban , sir benjamin d ' urban ' s wife , is now held by the museum africa in johannesburg . ro ##up ##ell is commemorated by pro ##tea ro ##up ##elli ##ae , named by the swiss botanist carl mei ##ss ##ner . the short - lived taxon ro ##up ##elli ##a gr ##ata , a flowering creep ##er from sierra leone and named to honour various members of the ro ##up ##ell family , was lump ##ed as st ##rop ##han ##thus gr ##atus by the french botanist henri ernest bail ##lon .",
