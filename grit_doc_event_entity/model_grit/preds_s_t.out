' my war ' , two volumes of pen , ink and wash drawings , published in 1931 by john lane , is a word ##less novel of his wartime experiences . his economy of line has been compared with that of eric gill and keith vaughan . he visited england in 1929 , holding a solo exhibition at the gi ##eves gallery in london . in 1936 he moved to cornwall with g ##wyn ##edd jones - parry , another painter , whom he married in 1937 . one of their wedding presents was alfred wallis ' ' three sailing vessels on a river ' given by jim ed ##e , who was a junior curator at the tate and purchased many of wallis ' paintings . the couple lived at ca ##unce head near mu ##lli ##on , cornwall on the lizard peninsula and stayed there for the rest of their lives . he exhibited with the newly ##n society of artists and the pen ##with society of arts . the mere fact that mr campbell dod ##gs ##on , the distinguished keeper of prints and drawings at the british museum , acts as sponsor to mr ist ##van s ##ze ##ged ##i - s ##zu ##ts , is sufficient guarantee for the merit of the work shown by that young hungarian artist at the gi ##eves gallery in bond street . they seem , almost without exception , to be the work of inspired moments , in which the true significance of a scene , a type or movement is revealed to the artist in a flash and transferred to paper with a few vigorous strokes or accents . they are akin to mr paul nash ' s memorable war drawings in intensity of real ##isation and simplicity of statement . mr s ##ze ##ged ##i - s ##zu ##ts does not appear to belong to any particular group . his art bears no marked national characteristics , although it is inspired by profound sympathy with national characteristic life and scenery . his gifts of synthesis and swift notation are akin to va ##sz ##ary ' s , but unlike the older artist he has remained unaffected by parisian influences .",

        "doctext": "james clifford ( 1936 \u2013 1987 ) was an australian painter who borrowed styles from other artists in the manner of psychedelic rock music artists who came after the major pop artists and were forerunner ##s of the post ##mo ##dern app ##ropriation movement of the 1980s . james clifford was born in mu ##swell ##brook in 1936 and in the sixties moved to sydney , where he studied with des ##ider ##ius orb ##an and exhibited at watt ##ers gallery . he worked in various styles and became distinctive early on , combining hard - edge painting with landscape and seas ##cape painting in ka ##lei ##dos ##copic perspectives , tropical landscapes , art nouveau borders and the surreal ##ism of gordon on ##slow ford , later incorporating col ##lage , occasionally text art , dec ##al ##com ##ania . clifford was openly same sex attracted however he described himself as a homo ##phobic homosexual . his paintings of the human figure were usually male homo ##ero ##tic nude ##s . his late paintings were lyrical abstraction and have been compared to ralph bal ##son ' s matter paintings of the early 1960s . the novelist patrick white , famously associated with painters ian fair ##weather , sidney nolan , brett white ##ley and chris o ' doherty , was collecting clifford ' s work from the mid sixties until the mid eighties . both clifford and white had family connections in the hunter region of new south wales . james clifford , chris o ' doherty , brett white ##ley and the painter / set designer desmond dig ##by were the four young artists patrick white collected most avid ##ly , the novelist bequeathed the works to the art gallery of new south wales . curator daniel thomas remarked of white ' s \" personal aesthetic \" : \" it was obvious to me that he went with anything that had sp ##ik ##y forms \" . clifford was a favourite of white , who described clifford as one of the best two living painters in australia . the author of patrick white , painter man ##que , helen verity hewitt has argued sidney nolan and brett white ##ley were the main australian artist influences on white ' s writing , although she compared clifford himself him to a central character in white ' s 1961 novel riders in the chariot , alf dub ##bo , an emotionally uncertain young painter . art historian helen verity hewitt has noted that some observers felt white ' s interest in james clifford was \" mis ##placed \" . curator barry pearce has said of white ' s art collection : \" a lot of the reasons patrick bought particular paintings died with him . . . he was slightly sub ##vers ##ive , buying paintings to help out artists who were not san ##ct ##ified by officials in museums \" . hewitt quotes el ##wyn lynn mu ##sing on the painter ' s \" fragile , dia ##pha ##nous , lyric ep ##hem ##eral ##ity \" . . . \" poised on uncertainty , their lyric ##ism almost di ##sg ##uising their anxiety \" ( p . 87 , patrick white , painter man ##que ) . clifford received favourable mention from a small number of notable art critics : bernard smith , james glee ##son , el ##wyn lynn and gary catalan ##o . catalan ##o wrote of clifford as a casualty of the \" provincial \" australian hard edged painting scene of the late 1960s , on which he commented : \" only a guilty provincial culture can so neglect its own , more native sources of renewal , and apply itself so ass ##idi ##ously to borrowed artistic fashion ##s . and that the field represented a fashion and not a convention is shown by the work of some artists who emerged at the same time as the exhibition . . . . to lynn the artist who seemed ' most defiant ##ly bored with the canons of flat ##ness ' was the sydney painter , james clifford . \" . . . \" his cinematic landscapes are a rapid series of takes : close - up shots ming ##le with distant vista ##s - there you see nothing but sky - and there was a forceful view of the ground . despite their original ##ity , they were not much admired by the critics , largely because they did not seem to be reflecting the going international concerns \" . the highly respected painter richard la ##rter was an admire ##r of clifford ' s skill in marble ##izing and dec ##al ##com ##ania . la ##rter wrote of clifford ' s marble ##d paintings : \" these works ranged from abstracts ( like the ones in this exhibition ) to paintings where waves , sandy beaches , cliffs , hills , swirling clouds in blue skies , expanse ##s of seas and harbour ##s with waves breaking and great sunset ##s were suggested . the paint used was mainly household enamel paint , the colours which ran into each other were usually cream , silver , white , ultra ##marine blue , pale blue , yellow , red and green . what was truly remarkable was that if you truly looked at the paint ##work there was no sign of any brush ##work . it was as if the paint had been magical ##ly placed on the canvas . yet how spend ##id ##ly had that paint been placed ; one could disc ##ern white top waves breaking , sand ##ed beaches , cliff faces , whole head ##lands with rolling hills beyond and turbulent water , not just breakers \" . the organic forms and psychedelic effects found in clifford ' s art are in keeping with the trends in imagery associated with psychedelic rock in the late nineteen - sixties , which was happening in london . later travels included time at the sri au ##ro ##bin ##do ash ##ram , pond ##iche ##rry , south india . four years spent living in india during the 1970s came to an end when clifford returned to sydney in a poor state of health , tube ##rc ##ular and emotionally distraught . he spent the remainder of his life in sydney and his art was collected by a few noted sydney art collectors . collectors of clifford ' s work included macquarie galleries director lucy swan ##ton , prominent art publisher mer ##vyn horton , go ##wing ##s men ##sw ##ear store heiress mo ##llie go ##wing and the painter max watt ##ers , whose collection is housed at the mu ##swell ##brook regional arts centre . a retrospective of clifford ' s work was held at the mu ##swell ##brook regional arts centre in 2008 .",
