{"docid": "pred-1", "doctext": "Leonardo da Vinci (English: /ˌliːəˈnɑːrdoʊ də ˈvɪntʃi, ˌliːoʊˈ-, ˌleɪoʊˈ-/;[a] 14/15 April 1452[b] – 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals ever to have lived.[4] While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he also became known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on science and invention; these involve a variety of subjects including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and palaeontology. Leonardo's genius epitomized the Renaissance humanist idea,[5] and his collective works compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary Michelangelo.[6]", "extracts": {"birth": [], "death": [], "nationality": [], "painter_name": []}}
